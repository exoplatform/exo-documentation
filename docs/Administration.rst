.. _CustomizingLookAndFeel:

==============================================
Customizing the look and feel of eXo Platform
==============================================

As a web-contributor or an administrator, you can easily customize the
look and feel of eXo Platform by editing the existing
``Globalstylesheet.css`` file or creating a new global stylesheet and
applying it into the portal.

Global stylesheet is a shared one which is applied into your entire
site. Global stylesheets of eXo Platform are put into the css folder to
manage the stylesheet of your desired site. This section aims at showing
you how to create and apply your own global stylesheet through **Sites
Explorer**.

This section covers the following topics:

-  :ref:`Creating a global stylesheet <CreatingGlobalStylesheet>`
   Detailed instructions on how to create, edit and rename a global
   stylesheet.

-  :ref:`Checking the display <CheckingDisplayOfGlobalStylesheet>`
   Steps to activate a global stylesheet and check its display.

.. _CreatingGlobalStylesheet:

Creating a global stylesheet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Click |image5| --> Content --> Content Explorer on the side navigation bar.

2. Select the ``Site Management`` drive in the drives list.

3. Select a site in the Sites Management panel, for example, ``intranet``, 
   then select the css folder.

4. Click |image6| to open the CSS File form which allows creating a new
   global stylesheet.

|image7|

5. Enter the name of global stylesheet into the Name field, for example,
   ``GlobalStylesheet_Orange``.

6. Set the value as "True" in the Active field to activate your global
   stylesheet for your site. "True" is set by default when a new global
   stylesheet is created. If you select "False", your newly created 
   global style will be disabled.

7. Input one positive integer into the Priority field, for example "10".

8. Define your styles in the ``CSS Data`` field. Here, you can directly
   enter your CSS rules, or copy and paste them from your favorite text
   editor.

   For example, you can define your styles with the following 
   CSS:
   
   ::
   
    .UIToolbarContainerDark .NormalContainerBlock .ToolbarContainer {
      background-color: orange;
                        background-image: none;
      background-repeat: repeat-x;
      border-bottom: 1px solid #2C3440;
    }



Click Save or Save & Close to save your newly created global stylesheet.
You will see your global stylesheet in the Sites Management panel.

|image9|

.. note::  
           -  The values in both of the Active and Priority fields decide if your newly created global stylesheet is applied into 
              your site successfully or not.

     -  If the Active field is set to "True" in many global stylesheets, the system will automatically merge all the global 
        stylesheets into the ``${site-name}/Enterprise/Stylesheet-min-lt.css`` file of the css folder in the ascending order 
        and get the stylesheet with the highest priority. 
        Thus, after selecting "True", to make sure that your stylesheet is applied, you need to pay attention to the priority 
        level so that the selected priority of your stylesheet is higher than those of other global stylesheets in the css folder.

     -  The default global stylesheet will be automatically created in the css folder when you create a new site. 
        However, this global stylesheet can be overwritten by either setting "False" for its Active field or setting the higher 
        priority for other global stylesheet than that of the default global stylesheet.
              
            -  When you want to create a common stylesheet to share for all sites in the portal, you should create one in the 
        Sites Management/shared/css folder. This stylesheet will be rendered and applied into your desired site when you 
        switch to it.

.. _EditGlobalStylesheet:

   files by turns.

2. Open your desired site by entering its URL in the address bar, for

.. _WebDAV:

======
WebDAV
======

WebDAV enables you to use the third party tools to communicate with
hierarchical content servers via HTTP. It is possible to add and remove
documents or a set of documents from a path on the server.

.. note:: If you add some documents (by uploading) via WebDAV, you should check carefully its version history. See :ref:`Document Versioning <via-webdav>` for more details.

**What is WebDAV?**

**WebDAV** is an abbreviation of **Web-based Distributed Authoring** and
**Versioning**. It is used to publish and manage files and directories
on a remote server. It also enables users to perform these functions on
a website.

WebDAV provides the following features:

*Locking*
    This feature prevents two or more collaborators from overwriting
    shared content.

*Site Manipulation*
    WebDAV supports the "copy" and "move" actions and the creation of
    *collections* (file system directories).

*Name Space Management*
    This function enables copying and moving webpages within a server's
    namespace.

**Why uses WebDAV?**

With WebDAV, you can manage content efficiently with the following
actions:

-  Copying/pasting content on your device and have those changes
   reflected in a host-based site.

-  Manipulating actions on a content easily, quickly and flexibly
   without accessing it directly via web browsers. Content can be
   accessed from anywhere and is stored in local directories.

-  Easily and quickly uploading content to eXo Platform simply by copying it
   into the appropriate directory.
   
.. _ConnectToWebDav:   

Connecting to WebDAV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In eXo Platform, there are 2 modes of WebDAV:

-  **Public**: Login is not required, and users can view all the public
   items. The URL to access will be:
   `http://mycompany.com:port/rest/jcr/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path} <http://mycompany.com:port/rest/jcr/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path}>`__
   or
   `dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/jcr/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path} <dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/jcr/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path}>`__.

-  **Private**: Login is required, and users can view all the items
   which they had access right. The URL to access will be:
   `http://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcr/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path} <http://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcr/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path}>`__
   or
   `dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcr/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path} <dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcr/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path}>`__.

In which:

-  **mycompany.com:port**: The URL of your site.

-  **RepositoryName**: The repository name.

-  **WorkspaceName**: The workspace name.

-  **path**: The path of the content.

The access to your workspace via various WebDAV clients is not the same.
This part will give instructions about using WebDAV over a web browser
and common WebDAV clients. It is assumed that you want to access the
Wiki Home of the "Support Team" space, do as follows:

**Over a web browser:**

Simply enter
`http://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcr/repository/collaboration/Groups/spaces/support\_team/ApplicationData/eXoWiki/WikiHome <http://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcr/repository/collaboration/Groups/spaces/support_team/ApplicationData/eXoWiki/WikiHome>`__
into the address bar of your browser. The selected content will be shown
in WebDAV as below:

|image149|

**Nautilus (Linux):**

1. Open Nautilus - the file manager (GNOME Files), then open the address
   bar (by using the hot key: Ctrl + L).

2. Enter
   ``dav://mycompany.com:8080/rest/private/jcr/repository/collaboration/Groups/spaces/support_team/ApplicationData/eXoWiki/WikiHome``

**"net use" command**

In addition, for Windows, you can use the "net use" command to connect a
drive in your computer with the shared resource of eXo Platform. The command
format will be:
``net use X: http://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcr/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path}``
where X: is the drive letter you want to assign to the shared resource.

1. Open the cmd screen.

2. Type the "net use" command, for example:

``net use E: http://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcr/repository/collaboration/Groups/spaces/support_team/ApplicationData/eXoWiki/WikiHome``,
   
   then hit Enter.

3. Enter username and password as requested in the screen. If your
connection is successful, you will get a message like: "The command
completed successfully". If not successful, check if you have followed
steps in :ref:`WebDAV Restrictions <WebDAV.Restrictions>`.

4. Open the Computer window, then select the **E:** drive. Here you will
   see the Wiki content of the Support Team space.

.. note:: If you still do not connect successfully, check if you have followed instructions in :ref:`WebDAV restrictions <WebDAV.Restrictions>`.

.. _WebDAV.Restrictions:

WebDAV restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some restrictions for WebDAV in different OSs.

**Windows 7/Windows 8**

When you try to set up a web folder by "adding a network location" or
"mapping a network drive" through My Computer, you can get an error
message saying that either "The folder you entered does not appear to be
valid. Please choose another" or "Windows cannot access... Check the
spelling of the name. Otherwise, there might be ...". These errors may
appear when you are using SSL or non-SSL. To fix this problem, do as
follows:

**Windows 7**

1. Click Start, type **regedit** in the Start Search box, then hit Enter 
   to open the Windows Registry Editor.

2. Find the key:
``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\services\WebClient\Parameters``.

3. Select ``BasicAuthLevel`` and change its value to 2. If this does not
   exist, create it as a ``REG_DWORD`` key.

4. Reboot your OS.

**Windows 8**

1. Go to Windows Registry Editor, then find the key:
``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\services\WebClient\Parameters``.

2. Select ``UseBasicAuth`` and change its value to 1. If this does not
   exist, create it as a ``REG_DWORD`` key.

3. Select ``BasicAuthLevel`` and change its value to 2. If this does not
   exist, create it as a ``REG_DWORD`` key.

4. Reboot your OS.

**Microsoft Office 2010**

If you have Microsoft Office 2010 or Microsoft Office 2007 applications
installed on a client computer, try to access an Office file that is
stored on a web server that is configured for Basic authentication from
the client computer. The connection between your computer and the web
server does not use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). When you try to open or
to download the file, you may see the following problems:

-  The Office file is not opened or downloaded.

-  You do not receive a Basic authentication password prompt when you
   try to open or to download the file.

-  You do not receive an error message when you try to open the file.
   The Office application will start, but the selected file is not
   opened.

To fix these errors, enable the Basic authentication on the client
computer as follows:

1. Click Start, type **regedit** in the Start Search box, then hit Enter.

2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:
``HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common\Internet``.

3. On the Edit menu, point to **New**, then click **DWORD Value**.

4. Type ``BasicAuthLevel``, then hit Enter.

5. Right-click ``BasicAuthLevel``, then click **Modify**.

6. In the Value data box, type **2**, then click **OK**.

7. Reboot your OS.

   , or :ref:`views the availability time of participants in an event <ViewingTimeAvailability>`, 
   or :ref:`sends a reminder email for an event/task <CreatingEventReminder>`.

-  In case they have been involved in tasks/events, once being
   suspended, they will not receive:

   -  Invitation emails from Calendar (after someone modified an event
      where the suspended user was participant already).

   -  Event/Task reminder emails from the Calendar application.

-  Calendars shared by suspended users remain to be available to the
   shared people.

   `forum permissions <SettingForumPermissions>`, :ref:`adds restricted audience <AddingRestrictedCategories>`
   or :ref:`grants permissions <SettingCategoryPermission>` in forum 
   categories.

Select the Memberships tab. Here, you can manage user roles in a
specific group.

By default, 9 membership types are available in eXo Platform including
Member, Author, Editor, Manager, Redactor, Validator, Webdesigner, Publisher and \*.

|image178|

The membership, such as `manager:/platform/users`, is defined by both membership type (manager, member, author...) 
and a group i.e. it is the combinaison between a group and a membership type to define the user's role in the group.

.. note:: The \* membership is identical to any other type, so choosing this type means adding all available membership types.

**Membership usage in eXo Platform**

In eXo Platform, the most used memships are `manager`, `member` and `*`.

- The `manager` role to define users with managing privileges
- The `member` role to define normal users in a group
- `*` all the roles combined, that means a user with * membership type will have the permissions assigned to all  membership types within this group

Other roles i.e. Author, Editor, Redactor, Validator, Webdesigner and Publisher are mainly used for the 
:ref:`publication process <PublicationProcess>` which could be 
:ref:`customized <PLFDevGuide.DevelopingContent.PublicationLifecycle.CreatingPublicationLifecycle>`.

The most used roles are:

- The `publisher` role defines users allowed to :ref:`publish content <PublishContent>` i.e. they are able to switch
  contents from staged to published status.
  
- The `Author` role defines users able to add and manage content in draft, pending or approved statuses.

Remaining roles could be used when you create your 
:ref:`own publication lifecycle <PLFDevGuide.DevelopingContent.PublicationLifecycle.CreatingPublicationLifecycle>`.

.. note:: For :ref:`Spaces groups <spacesGroups>`, a user belonging to a space could be either a manager or a member.
          No other memberships used in spaces groups.
          If you are a manger in a space, this allows you to acces :ref:`the space's settings <Manage-Space-Settings>`
          and manage the space. If you belong to the space as a member, you are just able to share and view content
          in the space.

.. _ManagingYourOrganization.SendingMailUserCreation:

Sending mail about users registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In eXo Platform registration page is by default disabled. An 
administrator can enable it by following this `guide <ManagingPermissions>` 
to make it accessible to guests so they can register to eXo Platform by
themselves.

To be notified about new users registration, an administrator can
configure eXo Platform to send him emails by following these steps:

1. Configure your SMTP server by following the :ref:`Outgoing mail service <PLFAdminGuide.Configuration.OutgoingMailService>` guide.

2. Configure the service used for sending emails in ``portal.war/WEB-INF/conf/admin/admin-configuration.xml``. 
   This file contains descriptions for each available parameter, 
   including:

   -  Two mandatory parameters:

      -  ``sendMailAfterRegistration``: Set this parameter to "true" to
      enable email sending after a user registration.

      -  ``mailTo``: Add your email address in which you wish to receive
      notifications about new registrations.

   -  Optional configurations of mail content:

      -  ``mailFrom``: This will be used as from header in the mail.

      -  ``mailSubject``: The Subject of the mail.

      -  ``mailMessage``: The content of the mail.

.. tip:: Use the **${user.userName}** token for **mailSubject** and**mailMessage** to be then replaced by the real username that have been registred.

To check if your configuration takes effect, restart the server and
register a new user. An email that notifies of newly registered user
should be sent to you.

.. _UserGuide.AdministratingSpaces:

.. note:: By default, only the super user (i.e. **root**) is allowed to create spaces and templates and only administrators (i.e.
          ``*:/platform/administrators``) are allowed to manage spaces and templates.

This interface contains three tabs:

- :ref:`Manage spaces <AdministratingSpaces.ManageSpaces>` tab displays the list of spaces with their properties (visibility, registration policy, Users) and the corresponding actions: ``edit``, ``delete`` and ``Space binding``.
- :ref:`Permissions <AdministratingSpaces.Permissions>` tab displays the list of groups who can :ref:`Create <Create-Space>` or :ref:`Manage <AdministratingSpaces.ManageSpaces>` spaces. 
- :ref:`Binding reports <Binding_reports>` tab allows to display **only to administrators** (i.e. members of the group platform/administrators) :ref:`the binding <SpaceGroupsBinding>` reports.

.. note:: Users field displays, for each space, the number of bound users, i.e. mapped from a group, per the total number
          of the space's members.


.. _AdministratingSpaces.ManageSpaces:

Manage spaces tab

|image308|

The "Manage spaces" tab can be seen by users belonging to any group listed in 
the "Manage spaces" permission of the :ref:`Permissions tab <AdministratingSpaces.Permissions>`.

|image307|

If the permission has no value defined in the interface, users in the groups defined
by the property :ref:`exo.social.spaces.administrators <SpacesAdministration>` in
:ref:`exo.properties file <Configuration.eXoConfiguration>` are allowed to manage spaces.

.. warning:: When the Manage spaces permission is both defined through the interface and 
             the configuration, the value in the interface takes precedence. 

.. note:: If the permission is neither defined through the interface nor by configuration, only administrators are
          allowed to access the Manage spaces tab.
          

Edit space
`````````````

The groups you selected are immediately added to the :ref:`Bound groups <boundGroupsSection>` section, 
but the "Add binding" process is launched when the job is executed.
The binding job is launched each 5 minutes and handles the selected groups binding.

.. _boundUsers:

At the end of the job's execution, all the members of the selected groups are added as bound users to the space:

-  A bound user could not be deleted by an administrator or spaces manager or space's owner. The delete action
   is replaced by the label "Bound user" with a tooltip explaining the origin of the user.
             
   |Bimage359|
   
             
-  A bound user can not leave a space in which he is bound, the ``Leave`` button becomes disabled when 
   the binding is set.
             
   |Bimage360|
             
.. note:: -  Note that the binding is made on group members independently of their roles in the group. They are added to the 
             corresponding space as members, except those who are managers in the space before the binding, they still in 
             the space with their role. 
          -  Users who were in the space before the binding become also bound users and so they can not leave 
             it nor be deleted by an administrator or spaces manager or the space's owner.      

.. _RemoveBinding:

Remove binding process
-------------------------

The remove binding process is the action of removing users derived from the binding. Unlike the "Add binding", the
"Remove binding" is done on a single group. You can find :ref:`here <RemoveBindingSteps>` the steps to remove a 
binding.

When you, as an administrator, click on the ``Confirm`` button of the :ref:`deletion confirmation message <DeleteConfirmationMessage>`, 
you are redirected to the :ref:`Binding reports <Binding_reports>` tab  with a new entry (space/group/Remove binding operation) 
and the group's item is immediately removed from the :ref:`Bound groups <boundGroupsSection>` section.

Same as for the **Add binding**, the "Remove binding" is also executed with a job which is launched each 5 minutes.
When the execution time comes, the "Remove binding" process removes all the group's users **except those who belong to the 
space before the binding**. 

If they are no more :ref:`bound users <boundUsers>` i.e. they don't belong to an another bound group, they resume their 
ability to leave space, and they become again deletable by spaces managers, platform admnistrators and the space's owner.

.. _SynchronizeBinding:

Synchronize binding
---------------------

Synchronize binding operation is the action made on space members following any change made on the bound group.

-  If you add a member to the bound group, he is **automatically added** to the space as 
   :ref:`bound user <boundUsers>`
-  If you remove a member from the bound group, he is **automatically removed** from the space even if this user
   belongs to the space before the space/group binding.

.. note:: The synchronize action also generates a report in the :ref:`Binding reports <Binding_reports>` tab.
          Only one entry per space/group binding is added to the reports table and its end date is updated each time a change is
          done on the group.

.. _Binding_reports:

Binding reports
-----------------

After making a binding operation i.e. add new space binding or remove a space binding or even update a bound group,
a report is generated and which could be viewed in the tab "Binding reports".
The binding reports table contains these information:

-  Space: for the space name and avatar
-  Group: for the bound group name
-  Start date: corresponds to the action's validation date i.e. the time of confirming the action (Add or Remove binding) in the confirmation message. 
-  End date: corresponds to the end of the group's members processing (addition or removal)
-  Operation type: Add binding, Remove binding or Synchronize
-  Added users: the number of the added users following the binding operation, it is 0 when the operation type is **Remove binding**
-  Removed users: the number of the removed users following the binding operation, it is 0 when the operation type is **Add binding**
-  File: a downloadable file in csv format

|Bimage369|

A filter allows you to filter the reports table by operation:

|Bimage370|

The search field allows to search by space name and return reports of spaces whose names corresponds to the keyword:

|Bimage371|

It is also possible to filter by operation type the search results:

|Bimage372|


.. _AddBindingReport:

Add Binding Report
```````````````````
Having added groups binding to a space, an entry **per group is added** to the reporting table:

-  The operation type is set to "Add binding"
-  Added users corresponds to the added users to the space following the group's binding
-  Removed users is 0

.. _RemoveBindingReport:

Remove Binding Report
```````````````````````
Having removed a group binding from a space, an entry is added to the reporting table:

-  The operation type is set to "Remove binding"
-  Added users is 0
-  Removed users corresponds to the removed users from the space following the group's binding removal

.. note:: -  If some users are bound and that they belong to more than one bound group, they remain in the space
             and they are not count in the reporting. 
             
          -  If a user was member of the space before the binding was created. When removing the binding, 
             he remains in the space and becomes again normal member i.e. not bound. So, he is not count 
             in the "Removed Users"  column. But, the information is present in the csv report file, in which 
             he is marked as "still in space".
         
         
.. _SyncReport:

Synchronization report
```````````````````````
Even the updates made on bound groups are tracked in the binding reporting.
In fact an entry is added per space/group for the synchronization. Each time a change is made on a bound group,
this entry is updated:

-  The start date corresponds to the fist update made on the group after the binding

-  The end date is updated each time a change is made on the group

-  The number of removed users is incremented by 1 if a user has been removed from the group by an administrator (The removal from the group could only be done singularly i.e. only one user per action)
   
-  The number of added users is increased if some users were added to the bound group by an administrator


.. _AdminAppCenter:

============================
Managing Application Center
============================

As a platform administrator, you can manage the Application Center by:

-  Defining the number of allowed favorite applications
-  Defining mandatory applications that appear in every favorite applications drawer/list

Adding a new page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before diving into how to add a new page, you need to clarify the
relationship between navigation node and page. Node and page are two
entities that are totally different and a node can be referenced to a
page. A page can only be accessed by users via a node.

.. _PageCreationWizard:

Using Page Creation Wizard
----------------------------

The **Page Creation Wizard** is available to the portal's administrators
and facilitates them to create and publish portal pages quickly and
easily. In this way, you are creating a navigation node and its page
together.

The whole process to create a new page can be divided into **3**
specific steps:

**Step 1: Selecting a navigation node and creating the page**

In the first step, you have to set Node Name and Display Name of your
page. You are also able to decide the pages visibility and the
publication period of the page.

1. Open the site to which you want to add a new page. You will be 
   switched to your selected site only after a few seconds.

   from the drop-down menu to open the Page Creation Wizard form.
   
   |image194|

The wizard is divided into two sections.

-  The left panel contains existing pages/nodes displayed in the tree
   hierarchy. Here, you can navigate up and down the node/page
   structure.

-  The right panel displays Page Editor where you can make changes on
   the selected navigation node. You can input parameters for your new
   page in this panel.

   |                      |    containers and the child containers can hold     |
   |                      |    applications. You can also drag a container to   |
   |                      |    another one that helps you create various        |

   |                      |    separately. Deleting the parent container means  |
   |                      |    that its child containers are removed as well.   |
   |                      |                                                     |

3. Define the page layout in the Page Layout tab.
4. Define permissions in the Permissions tab. This tab consists of four
   sub-tabs named Access, Edit, Move Apps and Move Containers.

   -  The Access tab shows all users who can access the page:

      -  If the value of the Owner Type field is "*Portal*\ ", the name of
         the current portal is automatically selected for the Owner Id
         field, so that the *Access* permission is assigned to all users
         who can access the current portal.

      -  If the value of the Owner Type field is "*Group*\ ", the *Access*
         permission is assigned to all users who are the members of the
         group that is selected in the Owner Id field of the Page Settings
         tab.

   To reassign the *Access* permission for the page, see details in the
   :ref:`Access permission <SettingPortalPermissions.AccessPermission>`
   section.

   -  The Edit shows all users who have the *Edit* permission on the page.

      -  If the value of the Owner Type field is "*Portal*\ ", the *Edit*
         permission is assigned to users who can edit the current portal.

      -  If the value of the Owner Type field is "*Group*\ ", the *Edit*
         permission is assigned to all users who are the members of the
         group that is selected in the Owner Id field of the Page Settings
         tab.

   To reassign the *Edit* permission for the page, see details in the

.. _Administration.ManagingPermissions:

====================
Managing permissions
====================

Permissions play an important role in accessing and performing actions
in eXo Platform. Depending on the permissions assigned by administrators,
users can gain the Access and/or Edit permissions to sites, pages and
various components of the sites.

In eXo Platform, **permission types** define what a user can do within a
site, including:

-  **Access permission** enables users to access sites, pages or
   applications and content in the site pages. This permission can be
   set for multiple member groups.

-  **Edit permission** enables users to make changes on sites, pages or
   applications and content in the site pages. This permission is set
   for only one group at one time.

-  **Move Apps permission** enables users to add, delete or move
   applications on sites and pages via drag and drop. This permission
   can be set for multiple member groups.

-  **Move Containers permission** enables users to add, delete or move
   containers on sites and pages via drag and drop. This permission can
   be set for multiple member groups.

And, **permission levels** specify where the users' permission types can
be applied in the site.

-  **Site**: The permission at the site level defines actions permitted
   on the site. Users with the access permission can view (but not edit)
   the site. Meanwhile, users with the edit permission at the site level
   can modify the site.

-  **Page**: The permission at the page level restricts users to several
   particular pages. Users are only able to see and/or edit pages they
   have been granted, depending on the permission type assigned to them.

-  **Application**: The permission at the application level defines who
   can access the application.

-  **Container**: An application, page, or site may be put into one or
   more containers. The permission at the container level restricts the
   Access permission to content inside it.

With these permission types and levels, administrators can effectively
control who can access and which actions users can perform within the
site. For this reason, you, as an administrator, need to clarify the
layered architecture of a site to grant appropriate permissions to
groups. The simplest way to understand is that:

-  A site consists of one or more pages. These pages may be put into one
   or more containers.

-  Each page normally contains content and/or application(s). These
   content and applications may be put into one or more containers.

If you want members under a group (**platform/guests**, for example) to
be accessible to one application on a site page, grant the Access
permission to that group at the following layers:

-  The application and its containers

-  The page and its container where the application is stored.

-  The page site and its containers.

In the case you only grant the Access permission to the
**platform/guests** group at the site and page layers, this group will
see the page, but not see the applications and content restricted in
that page. To be clearer, see the below example.

**Making guests accessible to the Register form of Intranet**


.. tip:: To make handy for checking permissions at all levels, it is recommended you use the root account to have the highest rights.

For the Intranet site, the Register form is already featured by the
Register application and put into the Register page (node) (by selecting
|image208| --> Portal --> Sites Management  then click on Edit Navigation next to **intranet**).

|image209|

By default, the Register node is already linked to the Register page and
this page already contains the Register application.

You can use the URL format to access pages existing on a site:
`http://mycompany.com:port/portal/{site\_name}/{node\_name} <http://mycompany.com:port/portal/{site_name}/{node_name}>`__.
Remember that {site\_name} and {node\_name} are **case-sensitive**.

In this scenario, log out and use the URL:
`http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet/Register <http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet/Register>`__.
Now, as a guest, you will be redirected to the Login form, not Register
form. This may be because the Access permission is not granted to the
**platform/guests** group (or is not made public) at the Register
application itself or its outer layers. To make it accessible to the
**platform/guests** group, do as follows:

1. Log in as root, then use
   `http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet/Register <http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet/Register>`__
   to go to the Register page.

2. Check the Access permission at the Register page level by clicking
   |image210| --> Page --> Edit Layout.

|image211|

-  i. At the application, the Access permission is already granted to
   the **/platform/guests** group by default.

-  ii. At the container (by selecting Containers tab in **Page
   Editor**), the Access permission is already granted to the
   **platform/guests** group. Repeat this step for each container.

 .. note:: Setting the \* membership for a group means that all its users are granted permissions to view the container block, regardless of their membership role.

-  iii. At the page (by selecting View Page properties at the **Page
   Editor** bottom), the Access permission is already granted to the
   **platform/guests** group.

.. note:: Remember to click |image212| to make your changes affect, if any.

3. Go to
   `http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet <http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet>`__
    to be at the site level, then select |image213| --> Site --> Edit Layout.
    
    |image214|

-  i. At the site container(s) containing the Register page, the Access
   permission is made public by default, meaning that all (including
   guests) can access at the site container.

-  ii. At the outermost layer of the Intranet site (by clicking Site's
   Config at the bottom of **Edit Inline Composer**), the Access
   permission is already assigned to the **platform/users** group only.
   This is the reason why guests cannot access the Register form. So, in
   the **Access tab**, you need to select Add PermissionPlatformGuests
   in the group pane, and **\*** in the membership pane. Alternatively,
   tick the Everyone checkbox.

.. note:: Remember to click |image214| to make your changes affect, if any.

4. Log out, then try using the
   `http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet/Register <http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet/Register>`__
   link. Now, as a guest, you still can view the Register form, not the
   Login form.

5. Optionally, if you want guests to be redirected to the Register form
   when they only enter
   `http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet <http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet>`__,
   simply move gradually the Register node to the top in the Navigation
   Management (by right-clicking **Register** and selecting Move Up - 
   you need to repeat this step until the Register node is at the top).

|image215|

Log out, then use the link:
`http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet <http://mycompany.com:port/portal/intranet>`__.
Now, you will be redirected to the Register form without entering the
exact URL of the Register page.

|image216|

.. note:: -  In this section, some examples and screenshots use :ref:`default groups and memberships <PLFAdminGuide.Configuration.PredefinedUserGroupMembership>`
             that are ready-made by configuration. To create groups and memberships as you want, see :ref:`Managing your organization <ManagingYourOrganization>`.

      -  Do not misunderstand that labels of predefined membership types, such as "manager" or "publisher", represent their permissions.
             This means, those labels do not define any permissions. If you create a page, you are the person who decides if a "manager" has access to your page or not.

Permissions in this section are divided into:

-  :ref:`Setting permissions on a site <ManagingPermissions.SettingPortalPermissions>`

-  `Setting permissions on a page <ManagingPermissions.SettingPagePermissions>`

-  `Setting permissions on a container <ManagingPermissions.SettingContainerPermissions>`

-  `Access permission on a category <ManagingPermissions.SettingAccessPermissionOnCategory>`

-  `Access permission on a portlet <ManagingPermissions.SettingAccessPermissionOnPortlet>`

Management and Monitoring Gadgets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Management** and **Monitoring** gadgets include gadgets designed
for providing the overall vision of the system. These gadgets monitor
the system and provide the current system performance statistics which
are especially useful for the system administrators and developers.

.. _MonitoringGadgets:

Monitoring gadgets
-------------------

eXo Platform provides 3 types of the Monitoring gadget:

-  Memory

-  Caches level

-  Application Statistics

You can use these gadgets from the Dashboard Workspace. However, you can
quickly use them via the Monitoring page by clicking Administration -->
Administration --> Monitoring on the top navigation bar.

|image287|

Memory
```````

The Memory gadget provides the statistics of heap and non-heap memory
via charts which show the part of used memory and remaining memory
during runtime.

|image288|

In the table next to the chart, you can see:

-  Used: The total used memory.

-  Free: The total free memory.

-  Total: The total memory.

.. _MonitoringGadget.CacheLevels:

Caches level
`````````````

The Caches level gadget displays the eXo cache levels and settings.
Based on these statistics, the administrators can configure the cache
settings properly to get better performance:

-  If the cache is full but the hit ratio is low (or missed ratio is
   high), it means the cache is full of unnecessary data. It should be
   cleared and/or its size is increased, or its lifetime is decreased.

-  If the cache is full and the hit ratio is high, this is good. It
   means most of data are retrieved from the cache, but not from the
   database, so the system gets better performances.

-  If the cache is empty, it should be configured differently, for
   example, increasing its lifetime.
   
   |image289|

-  The Consumption tab shows the overall cache consumption in the
   system.

-  The Hit ratio tab shows the ratio between requested data fetched from
   cache and data fetched from database.
   
   |image290|

The Details tab shows the cache level and the current cache settings.

|image291|

In which:

-  Max size: The maximum size of the cache.

-  Time to live: The lifetime (in seconds) of cache entries before being
   cleared.

-  Hit/Missed: The percentage of data fetched from cache versus the
   percentage of data fetched from database.

Application Statistics
```````````````````````

The Application Statistics gadget lists all information related to the
execution time of all applications in the portal, therefore
administrators and developers will know how fast applications are and
which ones should be optimized.

|image292|

The gadget consists of two tabs:

-  10 Slowest: Lists 10 slowest applications in the portal.

-  All: Shows the total number of applications and a list of the
   applications in the portal.

Each application provides you with the following information:

-  The execution phase next to the application name (if any). For
   example: AllSpacesPortlet/ACTION\_PHASE

-  The full path of the application when you hover your cursor over its
   name.

-  The average execution time (in ms) highlighted next to the
   application name.

   -  The time will be highlighted with the yellow color if it is more
      than 1000 ms and less than 5000 ms.

   -  The time will be highlighted with the red color if it is more than
      5000 ms.

-  exec: The number of executions of the application.

-  min: The minimum execution time of the application.

-  max: The maximum execution time of the application.


.. _ServiceManagement:

Service Management
-------------------

The Service Management gadget provides an interface to interact with
manageable services via REST management API.

You can use these gadgets from the Dashboard Workspace. However, you can
quickly use them via the Service Management page by clicking

To access wallets administration interface, you have to click on "Administration" menu from the side navigation, then "Reward" --> "Wallet" from second level side bar.

|image328|

"Wallets administration" interface is displayed containing the list of different users wallets. You can apply filters to display or hide wallets. 
The available filters are by default the type of owner of the wallet and the wallet's status: Disabled wallets are not displayed by default. You can also search for a wallet by owner's name.

|image329|

The wallets administration interface allows you to manage different wallets according to the wallet's status:

- For initialized wallets: The possible actions which are also common actions for all wallets are: 

Refresh: Allows you to refresh the information about the selected wallet. The action will display the uptodate information for the status and different balances of the concerned wallet.
Send Cauri: Allows you to send funds to this wallet from the admin wallet.
Disable wallet: Allows you to disable the wallet. This action is not irreversible, you can enable the wallet if needed.

|image330|

- For new wallets, you can make the following actions:

*Initialize wallet*: Allows you to activate the wallet and send the initial funds with a optionally a message to the wallet's owner.
*Reject wallet*: The action requires your confirmation. The wallet's owner will display a message informing that his wallet creation has been rejected and will have the possibility to request the initialization once again.

|image331|

Some warnings appear in the interface when:

The user or space is deleted
The wallet does not contain any funds
The wallet does not contain enough ether to make transactions:  For these wallets a "Send ether" action is available


.. note:: No action except "Refresh" is allowed for "admin" wallet.


.. _ManagingKudos:

===============
Managing Kudos
===============

You can manage the use of kudos in the platform from "Kudos settings" page. 
To access this interface, click on "Administration" menu from the top navigation, then "Reward" > "Kudos" from the drop-down menu.

|image333|

You can define how many kudos users can send  per period of time (week, month, quarter or year). 
You can also restrict the use of kudos to the members of a single space. Here, the space membership is simply used as a group permission. Authorized users will be able to send and receive kudos from any other space.

|image334|

You can review the list of kudos received and sent from the tab "Kudos List" of the same interface. The information of the sender and receiver are available.

|image336|

You can filter per period type and select the period in which you want to see all sent (and recieved) kudos.

|image335|



.. _ManagingRewards:

================
Managing Rewards
================

You can manage the rewards sending from "Reward administration" page. 
To access to this interface, click on "Administration" menu from the top navigation, then "Reward" > "Reward" from the drop-down menu.
The first thing to do is to setup how rewards will be calculated from the configuration tab. 
Then, from "Pools" tab you can create pools and assign users to them according to their domains. 
Since the use of the platform may not be the same from one team to another, and in order to ensure a fair distribution of rewards, regroup users in pools corresponding to their teams. 
Rewards will be distributed comparatively to members within the same pool. Hence, members of the same pool will compete together for rewards rather than with all the users of the platform.
Finally, when everything is setup correctly in both configuration and pools tabs, you can send rewards from the first tab.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuration is the third tab of Reward interface. 
This tab lets you manage the rewards sending, the periodicity and how rewards will be calculated for users at the end of each period.

|image337|

Choose the periodicity for sending rewards  : week, month, quarter, semester or year.
The interface currently offers two built-in rewarding programs : one  for kudos and  one for gamification points.
For each program, you can specify a minimal threshold to reward users. The default value is "0", which means that the users are rewarded automatically if they receive kudos or earn any gamification points.

Select the checkbox "Use pools" if you want to use the pools in the rewards calculation and this for kudos and gamification.

To control the rewards budget, pick one of the 3 policies:

- **By a fixed budget:** Set a fixed total amount of tokens to spend in rewards. This amount of tokens will be spread between the different users in proportion of their points compared to others. If pools are used, the tokens received by each user are calculated relatively to other members of the pool rather than all users. 
- **By a fixed budget per eligible member:**  This is a more dynamic way where the budget is sized dynamically according to the number of eligible (having earned more than the minimal threshold) users.  Here too, actual rewards are calculated taking in account pools if the option is checked.
- **By a fixed budget per point:** This is a very dynamic mode where each points earns a fixed amount of rewards. It is recommended for programs where the number of "points" is capped (like Kudos, but unlike gamification).

Click Save to validate and apply your rewarding programs configuration.


Pools
~~~~~

Pools is the second tab of Reward interface. 
As described above, this tab let you create pools and assign users to them according to their teams, roles, job title or any other criteria you choose in order to ensure a fair distribution of rewards. For fair distribution, all pool members should have equal chances to compete with others. Thus, they should have access to same or similar gamified areas in the workplace.
When no pool has been defined and no user have created a wallet yet, the interface will look like this

|image338|

When users create their wallets, they will be automatically assigned to the default pool until you assign them to an appropriate one.

|image340|

To create a pool, click on the '+' button. You only need to enter the pool's name to be able to create it. 

|image339|

You can also optionally  add a descripton, choose a space in order to add all its members to the pool and/or select a pool manager.

You can fine tune budget per pool :

- **By computing pool reward from total budget: ** It's the default option. The budget attributed to this pool will be computed automatically according to the budget set in the Rewarding programs configuration
- **By a total fixed budget: ** With this option, this pool's budget will not be taken from the global budget. Instead the pool will have its own fixed budget.
- **By a fixed budget per eligible member: ** With this option, the pool has its own dynamic budget based on the number of eligible users in the pool.

Then you can add users to the pool and save.

It is possible to enable or disable a pool using the available option from the pool's card. If a pool is disabled at the moment of sending rewards, its members will not recieve tokens.

|image341|

|image342|


Send Rewards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once everything is setup correctly, you can send the rewards from the first tab of reward interface.

|image343|

Reward sending is allowed after the selected period of reward is past. You can't send rewards before the end of the period conforming to the periodicity set in the Configuration tab.
The button "Send rewards" is disabled when the current period is selected.

|image344|

From this interface, you have the following information:

- **Eligible users:** Displays the number of eligible users for the selected period.
- **Total budget:** Displays the total amount of tokens (to be) distributed for the selected period.
- **Sent Cauri:** Displays the amount of token sent if the transaction has been proceeded.
- **Reserve fund:** Displays the amount of token available  in the reserve. Tokens are sent from the reserve to users. Make sure you have enough funds in the reserve before sending rewards or some users may not receive anything.
- **Total kudos:** Displays the total number of kudos received during the selected period.
- **Total gamification:** Displays the total number of gamification points earned during the selected period.

For convenience, you can search for a user by his name, pool or wallet address. 

|image347|

You can also display the disabled users using the appropriate radio button. 

|image346|

The available information for each user are the following:

- Fisrt and last name
- Actual pool
- Transaction
- Status
- Amount of reward
- Information icon

When you click on the information icon you see the reward details of the associated user.

|image345|

.. _BuildingOnlineCommunity:

============================
Building an online community
============================

Many users ask for building a Community site like
http://community.exoplatform.com. In this site, they want to allow their
users to register by themselves, or publish some pages, such as Forum.
This tutorial will guide you how to do these tasks via UI.

.. note:: This tutorial has some limitations due to using UI only. For example, you can allow users to access the Register page, but when a user finishes his registration, he is not automatically redirectedto Home page. 
          To go further, you need to do some development tasks. And if you meet any troubles, go to `eXo Forum <http://community.exoplatform.com/portal/intranet/forum>`__ to get some help.

Before you follow the step-by-step instruction to allow Guest access,
let's learn the "portal manner" of access control:

.. _PublishSiteAndPages:

Publishing sites and pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you access *intranet* site, you are asked to log in, because the
access permission of the site is *\*:/platform/users* by default. So, to
publish any resource under the "intranet" site, you need to make the
site public first. And what happens then?

When the site is public, but all the pages are private, then you are
still seeing a login form. If there is one public page, the portal will
redirect you there without login. If there are several public pages, the
topmost one in the site navigation will be the default redirection.

Knowing this, you can allow anonymous users to access some public pages.
In the example, you will publish Wiki and Forum, and put a new page
called "Welcome" as the default page for anonymous access.

.. _EnableUsersRegister:

How to enable users to register themselves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

eXo Platform provides a built-in *Register* page already. See the
screenshot below:

|image294|

The page is not a public one, but the membership *\*:/platform/guests*
has access permission, so if the site is public, anonymous users can
type the URL */portal/intranet/Register* to access this page. You can
put a link in the *Welcome* page so that the user does not have to type
the URL.

The Welcome page should also give a *Login* link. Hereunder is the web
content (simplified) you should add to Welcome page:

.. code:: html

    <a href="/portal/login">Sign in</a>
    <a href="/portal/intranet/Register">Register</a>

.. _SiteNavigation:

Site Navigation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have read that the topmost page in Site Navigation will be picked up
for redirection, when users access */portal/intranet*. The Site
Navigation can be edited by clicking Edit --> Site --> Navigation from 
the top navigation bar.

See the screenshot. You can right-click on a page (actually a "node")
and choose Move Up (several times) to change the order of the pages.

|image295|

In the example, you publish Welcome, Wiki and Forum pages so you should
"Move Up" the Welcome page to the top, but below the *Home* page. This
makes Welcome the default page for anonymous while keeping *Home* the
default page for logged users.

You want the Welcome page to offer anonymous users the "Login/Register"
links, but logged-in users should not see it. Though they always can
access by typing page URL, it is nice to hide Welcome page from the Left
Navigator.

To do that, right-click again and choose "Edit this Node", then uncheck
the *Visible* box in the form:

|image296|

.. _BuildingOnlineCommunity.LeftNavigator:

Left Navigator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can publish the Left Navigator for anonymous access. It is a smart
navigator that shows users a page link if and only when the user has
access permission to the page, so anonymous only see public pages.

The Left Navigator is in fact "some containers and portlets" included in
the Site Layout, so you can edit it by clicking Edit icon --> Site --> 
Edit Layout.

Exactly, you need to publish the portlet **UICompanyNavigationPortlet**
and publish its containers as well. See the illustration. There are
three (nested) containers, the outermost one is public by default.

|image297|

Publishing a content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Almost every page is a portal page which consists of containers and
portlets. It is the portlet that brings content to you. In order to
allow anonymous users to view a content, you need to publish: the
portlet that presents the content, the containers of the portlet, the
page and the site. See the following illustration, note that containers
can be nested:

|image298|

The content access also is managed by the relevant application. Wiki
application allows you to set permission for any individual page. In
Forum, the permissions can be set for topic, forum and category. In case
of Content, each content has its publication lifecycle.

Make it public
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To publish the **intranet** site, go to either of its page, like Home
page, and click Edit icon --> Site --> Edit Layout from the top navigation bar, 
then select Site's Config from the Edit Inline Composer window. In the
Permissions --> Access, tick the *Everyone* checkbox.

|image299|

The *Everyone* checkbox is also available when you edit a page and its
portlets and containers.

When you are on the page you want to edit, click Edit --> Page -->Layout 
from the top navigation bar. This will open a layout of the portlets and 
the containers, and a **Page Editor** floating box.

-  To edit the page access permission: click View Page properties.

-  To edit a portlet's access permission: hover your cursor over the
   portlet area to see a toolbar.

-  To edit a container's access permission: similar as the portlets, but
   you need to click the **Containers** tab in the Page Editor window.

Building an online community by example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, you build a "Welcome" page and make it the default page
for anonymous users and give them links to login or register. You also
publish the Forum and Wiki page to allow anonymous users to view.

You should have administrator privileges. Remember to Save your
modification at every step.

1. Publish the intranet site.

2. Publish the left navigator, or more exactly the portlet
**UICompanyNavigationPortlet** and its containers.

See the above :ref:`Left
Navigator <BuildingOnlineCommunity.LeftNavigator>` for details.

3. Create a web content that gives the links to login and register, as
   follows:

Click Administration --> Content --> Sites Management. You can create the 
content somewhere in a general drive, for example
``Sites Management:/intranet``.

Choose the template *Web Content*:

|image300|

Input title as "welcome" for example. Click **Source** (see the
screenshot) then put the following code to its content:

.. code:: html

    <table style="width: 100%">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td style="width: 1px; white-space: nowrap">Please login if you have an account already:</td>
                <td><a class="btn btn-primary" href="/portal/login">Sign in</a></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td style="width: 1px; white-space: nowrap">Or register a new one:</td>
                <td><a class="btn btn-primary" href="/portal/intranet/Register">Register</a></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

|image301|

Save and publish the content.

|image302|

4. Create a *Welcome* page. Take care to create the page in the same 
   level with the Home page.

Add the **Content Detail** portlet to the page. Edit the portlet to
select the content you created.

|image303|

Publish the portlet and the page.

5. Move up the *Welcome* page as described in :ref:`Site Navigation <SiteNavigation>`.
Also, make the page **invisible**.

6. Publish *Forum* page.

7. Publish *Wiki* page. As the Wiki Home is restricted by default, 
   publish it as well.

The following image shows the screen when an anonymous user accesses
*/portal*.
