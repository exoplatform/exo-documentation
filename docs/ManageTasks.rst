    In this chapter, you will be introduced to the
    Task Management application which allows you to manage all
    collaborative activities under tasks. This application is aimed at
    improving the way that a team focuses their efforts on a project and
    communicates to get work done.

    In this chapter:

.. _NewTasks:

========================
New Tasks Application
========================

.. note:: At the moment of writing this documentation, tasks and new tasks applications cohabit and each of them could be used. However, the new tasks app still missing some
          features which exist in the tasks app.

With eXo Platform 6.1, Tasks application has been made a new skin for more confortable and user-friendly usage.
Discover what's new in Tasks application in the following sections.


.. _MyTasks:

My Tasks
~~~~~~~~~

TASKS tab is where you can find the tasks assigned to you and tasks where you are set as coworker.

The list of my tasks could be displayed in two views: List or Cards.

|NewTask00|

The LIST view displays in a list form the tasks I created either in a project or not, my assigned tasks and those I am set as coworker.

|NewTask01|

CARDS view of my tasks displays the same tasks in a different view. Each task is represented by a card.

Both views, i.e. list and cards display the same details: 

- Task's title
- Task's ID
- Task's project if it belongs to a project, otherwise display the label 'No project'
- The avatars of participants to the project i.e. the assignee and coworkers if they exist
- The number of associated labels if they exist otherwise, display the label 'No label'
- The number of comments and attachments 
- The task's status in its project, otherwise display the label 'No status'
- The task's due date if it is set, otherwise display the label 'No due date'

When a task has many coworkers, you just need to click on the +x label over the avatar to open a drawer with the whole list of assignee and coworkers.

|NewTask05|


.. _Myprojects:

My projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PROJECTS tab is where you can find your projects i.e. those you are the manger and those you are participant in.

With the new tasks application, projects are represented in CARDS forms.

A project's CARD displays the following details:

- The project's name
- An information icon
- 3 dots icon displaying the possible actions I can make on the project
- The project's description , if it exists, otherwise display 'No description' label
- Space's avatar and name if the project belongs to a space, otherwise, 'No space' label with an empty icon is displayed
- The project's managers avatars
- Star button allowing to favorite a project

|NewTask02|


Clicking on the information icon flips the project's card to display a pie chart with statistics about the project's tasks.

|NewTask03|


.. _AddProject:

Add a new project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A button is displayed in the top-left "Add project" which opens a drawer allowing to add a new project

|NewTask04|

A project is defined by these properties:

- A title, mandatory to set
- At least one Manager, set by default to the project's creator but could be edited
- At least one participant, which could be a user or a group
- A description which is not mandatory

.. _SearchProject:

How to search for a project?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can find a project through the filter field by entering a keyword contained in the project title or description.


.. _AccessProjectTasks:

How to access a project's tasks?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To access the list of tasks in a project, just click the project title on the CARD. Two views are available for tasks : BOARD and LIST.
By default, tasks are displayed in the BOARD.


|NewTask09|


.. _AddTask:

How to add a new task?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add a task either in your Tasks list (i.e. under TASKS tab) or under a project in which you are already a participant or manager. 
Click on "Add Task" button |NewTask07| .
A drawer opens allowing you to fill in the task's fields. 

|NewTask08|

.. tip:: Only the title field is mandatory to save a task.

.. note:: The differences between a task added under TASKS tab and under a project:
          
          -  In TASKS tab, the task is pre-assigned to you by default.
          
          -  Within a project, the project field is pre-filled with this project.


You can edit a task by clicking on its title which opens the "Edit task" drawer.

|NewTask10|

.. _SearchTask:

How to search for a task?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Searching for a task works the same within the TASKS tab and within a project.

To quickly find a task, you can use the filter field, to filter based on the list of tasks displayed. But for more
advanced cases, you can use the filter button to select multiple criteria as well as grouping and sorting options.

.. _SearchTaskFilterField:

Finding a task using the Filter field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use the first alternative .i.e. the filter field, you just need to type a keyword in the field. The returned results correspond to tasks containing the keyword in their 
title or description.

|NewTask06|


.. _SearchTaskFilterBtn:

Finding a task using the Filter button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The filter button opens a drawer with more advanced criteria, grouping and sorting options.

Group and Sort tab
````````````````````
The group and sort tab allows you to group and/or sort tasks according to the selected choices.

|NewTask15|

The "Group by" option groups the resulting tasks by a common criteria such as due date, assignee, etc.
It's very useful to review the project from a certain angle.

The "Sort by" options allows to sort tasks in an order according to a criteria. For example when sorting by priority, tasks with the highest priority appear first within their group.

.. note:: Note that some criteria in the "Group and Sort" tab differ between project's tasks and TASKS  tab. For example, grouping the tasks of a project by project does not make sense, so that option is not offered.

Filter tab
```````````

The "Filter" lets you run a custom search based on multiple criteria combined with a logical "AND".


|NewTask12|

- Contains: Enter any keyword in that field to match tasks that contain these words in their title or description. It works exactly like the
  filter field when it is the only filled criteria.
- Assignee: Lets you filter tasks assigned to a specific user. Start typing a name to trigger a list of suggested assignees among the participants of this project.
- Due: Let you filter tasks based on their due date. A dropdown menu offers shortcuts : All, Overdue, Today, Tomorrow, Upcoming. 
- Priority: Lets you filter tasks for a given priority. A dropdown menu offers the options : All, High, Normal, Low, None. 
- Show completed tasks:  when turned on, this option lets you display :ref:`completed tasks <finishtask>` as well as the others.

At the bottom of the drawer, three actions are available :

- Confirm: Validates the criteria and applies the filters to the current board/list of tasks.
- Cancel: Dismisses the drawer without applying the filters.
- Reset: Clears all criteria, resetting them to their default value.

Labels tab
````````````

The "Labels" tab allows you to filter tasks based on their labels.

|NewTask16|

.. tip:: Currently, labels are combined with a logical 'AND' meaning the filtered list/board will contain tasks that have all the selected labels.

.. _finishtask:

Mark a task as completed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


When you are done on a task and that you want to mark it as completed, you need simply to click on the radio button near the task's title. 
The task will disappear from the list/board (unless you selected "Show completed tasks" option in the filter dropdown).

|NewTask13|

|NewTask14|

.. _ChangeStatus:

How to change the status of a task?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To reflect the progress of a task, you can change its status. There are two ways of doing it:

-  Edit the task to change it and select the corresponding status in its Status field.
-  Drag the task and drop it to the desired status column (BOARD view) or grouping (LIST view).

.. note:: The drag & drop option is inly available on projects views.

.. _Intoduction:

==========================
Task management overview
==========================

To use your Tasks management application effectively, there are
some terms that you should be aware of:

-  **Projects**: Containers of tasks.

-  **Management views**: Two views (Board and List) that provide you
   with different ways to manipulate your tasks.

-  **Project workflow**: The list of statuses that tasks in a project
   can take. By default, a new project will have the following workflow:
   *To Do, In Progress, Waiting On* and *Done*. Alternatively, you can
   change the project workflow later in the Board view.
   	
	- To Do: tasks which will be done in the future.
	
	- In Progress: tasks being handled at that time.
	
	- Waiting on: tasks waiting a decision or a validation i.e. awaiting a third party.
	
	- Done: tasks on which work is ended.

.. note:: Changing the default workflow for new projects is done only by
			the administrator, see :ref:`this section <#PLFAdminGuide.Configuration.TaskManagement>` 
			for more details.

-  **Sub-project**: A project can have any number of sub-projects and a
   sub-project can also have an unlimited number of smaller
   sub-projects. These sub-projects will inherit permission and workflow
   from their parent project at the creation time and you can change
   them later.

-  **Space project**: For each new space, a project with the same name
   will be automatically created when the Tasks management
   application is added to the space.

The Tasks management overview is divided into three main areas,
including left, central and right panes.

|image0|

.. _Left-pane:

**The left pane**


|image1|

This pane includes three sections:

.. _Tasks-filters:

-  **Tasks**: manages tasks individually by left filters. These filters
   are:

   -  *Incoming*: filters tasks that are not yet assigned to a project.
      This filter also excludes completed tasks by default, but you can
      change this by using the top :ref:`Filter <Filtering>` feature.

   -  *All Tasks*: shows unfiltered list of all tasks assigned to the
      current user.

   -  *Overdue*: filters tasks with a past due date.

   -  *Today*: filters tasks that are due today.

   -  *Tomorrow*: filters tasks that are due tomorrow.

   -  *Upcoming*: filters tasks that are due in future.

-  **Projects**: manages tasks by projects. Specifically, you can manage
   the workflow of tasks that are assigned to a project.

-  **Labels**: manages tasks by labels. You can set any label on a task
   to classify it for you to manage your tasks more easily.

.. _Central-pane:

**The central pane**


This pane is used to display tasks filtered via the left pane and 
:ref:`top Filter <Filtering>`. In case you are in a project, a *Board* 
view is provided so that you can manage the project's tasks more easily.

.. _Right-pane:

**The right pane**

This pane displays details of the task that is selected from the central
pane where you can modify any information of the task.

    .. note:: Inside spaces, the Tasks management overview is similar as
			above, but the project list is filtered to display only projects
			that are accessible for the members of the spaces. Besides, there
			will be no *Incoming* filter on the left menu and clicking on a
			label will display only the tasks with the selected labels in the
			spaces' projects.
		
.. _tasks-permissions-overview:

**Tasks permissions**


Task Management application comes with different roles and permissions allowing users to better manage their tasks and projects:

	- **The reporter**: is the task's creator, able to **add**, **edit** and **comment** any of his tasks.
	- **The project participant**: he maybe the task's assignee or coworker, able to **comment**, **edit** add and **delete** tasks 	   on the project. He **can not delete** tasks he not the creator.
	- **The project manager**: he could be the project creator, the space manager or the platform manager (i.e the super user root 		  or from platform/adminstrators group). Users having this role have the **same permissions as a project participants** and 	       they are also able to **edit the workflow**, **create subprojects** and also **delete** any task in the project.
	- **The observer**: is a user who have been mentioned in the task and is not a participant, is just **able to view the task**.
	
	
.. note:: In tasks application under a space, all space members get automatically the participant role.
	
	
.. _Manage-task:

==============
Managing tasks
==============

This part introduces you how to:

* :ref:`Create a task <CreateTask>`
* :ref:`Edit a task <EditTask>`
* :ref:`Schedule a task <ScheduleTask>`
* :ref:`Get permalink of a task <GetPermalink>`
* :ref:`Clone a task <CloneTask>`
* :ref:`Delete a task <DeleteTask>`
* :ref:`Filtering tasks <Filtering>`


.. _CreateTask:

Creating a task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Anyone can create personal tasks. In project's frame, managers and participants are able to create tasks under their 		  projects.

Creating a task in eXo Platform is designed as an effortless operation, so
you just need to follow one of the following ways.

**Via Tasks management overview**


1. Click any items (except *Overdue*) under the **Tasks**, **Projects** or **Labels** sections.

2. Enter the task title into the single line text box under the New Task button:

|image2|

3. Hit **Enter** key to create this task.

    .. note:: -  If you choose to create the task in a filter, it will be put into
				that filter and automatically assigned to the currently logged-in
				user. Note that for the *Upcoming* filter, the due date will be
				the next seven days, while for the *Today* and *Tomorrow*
				filters, the due date will be today and tomorrow respectively.

				-  If you choose to create the task in a project or label, it will
				belong to that project or labelled to that label. Besides, by
				default it will not be assigned to anyone.

**Via Activity stream**


You can even create a task outside the Tasks Management application by 
using the following syntaxes on the Activity stream:

-  Creating a task: ++\ *task\_title*.

-  Setting priority: !\ *task\_priority*. Recognized priorities include
   *High, Medium* and *Low*.

-  Assigning: @\ *task\_assignee* @\ *task\_coworker\_1*
   @\ *task\_coworker\_2*

-  Setting due date: ^\ *due\_date*. Recognized syntaxes include *Today,
   Tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
   Sunday, Next Week, Next Month* and *dd-mon* (e.g *12-apr* for 12th
   April).

-  Tag: #\ *tag*. The tag will be created if it does not exist.

See this example:

|image3|

**Or via comment:**


|image4|

You will see that there are two new tasks created as below:

|image5|

    .. note:: - Anyone that has access permission to a task can do anything on the task.
			  -  By default, tasks inherit permissions from the project they are in. Therefore, all members and managers of the project are able to access these tasks. 
			     In case they are not assigned to any project, only the creator, assignee and coworkers are granted the access permission.


.. _EditTask:

Editing a task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Task's edit permission is granted to:

		  - The task's creator
		  
		  - The project manager
		  
		  - The space manager (for space's tasks application)
		  
		  - The platform manager (super user and platform/administrators members
		  
		  - The project participants
		  
		  - The task's assignee
		  
		  - The task's assignee cowroker


After creating a task, the right pane will be opened for you to edit the
task directly (if you create the new task via the overview interface) or
you can choose any other task from the central pane. The details of a
task are as follows:

|image6|

In which:

-  |image7|: the name of the project that the task belongs to. In case
   the task is not assigned to any project, this field says "*No
   Project*\ ".

       .. note:: -  To select a project for a task, you must have permission on
          that project. Besides, a task should belong to only one
          project, so you should remove the existing project from the
          task before adding a new one.

       -  If you move a task to another project, its status will be set
          to the same one in the new project workflow (statuses must
          match alphabetically to be considered the same). If no status
          matches in the new project workflow, the status is set to the
          first one in the new project workflow.

-  |image8|: the labels that are assigned to the task.

-  |image9|: the title of the task which should be from 1 to 250
   characters.

-  |image10|: the due date of the task. You can choose among 4 options,
   including *None, Today, Tomorrow* and *Next Week* or specify any
   other due date.

-  |image11|: the assignee and co-workers that are assigned to the task.
   Only one assignee is accepted, while you can add multiple co-workers.

-  |image12|: the status of the task in the project workflow. Note that
   this information is available only for the tasks that are assigned to
   a specific project.

-  |image13|: the task description.

-  |image14|: the schedule of the task. If no schedule is specified,
   this field says "*Unscheduled*\ ". To remove the current schedule,
   hover cursor over it and select the deletion icon that appears.

-  |image15|: the task priority. You can choose between 4 values,
   including *High, Normal, Low* and *None*.

-  |image16|: the **Comments** tab allows people to discuss about the
   task, while the **Changes** tab shows all changes history of the
   task.

   |image17|

-  |image18|: the *Mark as completed* feature, clicking this icon will
   mark the task as completed and it will disappear from the List and
   Board views unless :ref:`Filter <Filtering>` is set to show completed
   tasks.

    .. note:: A formatting toolbar appears once you click in the comment composer.
				It allows you to change the formatting of your message, attaching
				images and links and preview how it will look once posted. (like
				what we have for :ref:`the activity stream composer <posting-status-updates>`)

To edit the task:

1. Hover cursor over any information and click it that you want to edit.

2. Make changes on the task, then hit **Enter** key or just click out the edited field.

.. _ScheduleTask:

Scheduling a task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After creating a task or being assigned one, you can schedule it by
following these steps:

|image19|

-  |image20|: Select the list of tasks by clicking on All Tasks.

-  |image21|: Select one of the assigned/created tasks.

-  |image22|: Click on Unscheduled.

Two calendars appear to select From and To dates.

|image23|

After saving the selected dates, a message is displayed under the task's
description indicating the time interval chosen with a note about the
schedule:

-  If the To date is chosen after the due date, a message appears to
   warn that you may miss the deadline because you planned the work too
   late.

   |image24|

-  If the To date is chosen before the due date, the message that
   appears indicates that the work is planned between the chosen dates.

   |image25|

    .. note:: -  When the today's date is the task's due date, a blue exclamation mark |image26| precedes the task's name in the list/board view.
			  -  When the task's due date has already expired, i.e. today's date is after the due date and the task is not yet finished, it is preceded with a red exclamation mark: |image27|
				 
				 |image28|

==============
Managing views
==============

eXo Platform supports two views which are:

* :ref:`List view <list-View>`
* :ref:`Board view <Board-View>`


.. _list-View:

list View
~~~~~~~~~~

By default, when you access any item on the left pane, the corresponding
tasks in the central pane will be displayed in a simple list like this:

|image73|

In which:

-  The **!** symbol in red indicates overdue tasks that have not been
   completed on time.

-  The **!** symbol in blue indicates tasks that need to be done today.

In this view, you can do the followings:

Marking a task as completed:
-----------------------------

Hover cursor over the task that you want to mark it as completed and
click the tick icon that appears:

|image74|

The task will disappear from the List view unless
:ref:`Filter <Filtering>` is set to show completed tasks.

.. _sort-tasks-list-view:

Sorting/Grouping tasks
-----------------------

At the top right corner of the central pane, there are two options under
the top filter that help you to sort and group tasks in categories.

|image75|

You can arrange these tasks by the following options:

-  *Created Date*: sorts by the created date of tasks, with the most
   recent tasks on top.

-  *Due Date*: sorts by the due date of tasks, with the oldest tasks on
   top.

-  *Title*: sorts by the task titles in alphabetical order.

-  *Priority*: sorts by the task priority, with the highest on top.

-  *Rank*: sorts by the task rank.

In addition to sorting tasks by the above options, you can also group
the tasks by:

-  *Assignee*: groups by the tasks' assignee.

-  *Label*: groups by the tasks' label.

-  *Due Date*: groups by the tasks' due date.

-  *Project*: groups by projects.

-  *Status*: groups by the tasks's status in a project.

-  *None*: ungroups tasks.

.. note:: Depending on the view you select from the left pane, such as Task
			filters, Projects or Labels views, some of the options above may be disabled.


.. _Board-View:

Board view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This view is designed only for projects, therefore you need to go to a
specific project to see this view. In this view, you can manage tasks as
well as the project workflow:

|image76|

In which:

-  Each column corresponds to a status of the project workflow.

-  The color of a task card depends on its priority: *High* - Light Red,
   *Medium/Normal* - Light Orange, *Low* - Light Green, None priority -
   Light Gray.

-  The number of tasks in a column is displayed next to the status name.

Creating new tasks:
----------------------

In addition to creating new tasks by :ref:`this way <CreateTask>`, you can quickly do this via the Board view as follows:

1. Hover cursor over the last task of a column (or grouping), an editable
field will appear:

|image77|

2. Type the task title in this field, then press Enter key. Your new task
will be created immediately in the corresponding column.

Sorting/Grouping tasks:
------------------------

|image78|

You can sort these tasks by the *Due Date, Priority* and *Rank* options
as well as group them by the *Assignee, Label* and *None* options as in
:ref:`this view <sort-tasks-list-view>`.

Moving tasks
-------------

You can drag/drop tasks back and forth between assignees, labels and
statuses.

-  Between statuses:

   |image79|

-  Between assignees:

   |image80|

-  Between labels:

   |image81|

Managing project workflow
--------------------------

By default, your project will have a workflow with four statuses
including *To Do - In Progress - Waiting On - Done* and you can change
it on your own.

-  To modify a status, double-click the status name in the Board view,
   and type the new name in the editable field that appears:

   |image82|

   Press Enter key to finish updating.

-  To delete a status, hover cursor over the status name in the Board
   view, and select the delete icon that appears:

   |image83|


.. note:: -  All tasks assigned to the deleted status are affected to the previous status (the column on the left in the Board view).
		  -  If the status is the first of the list (the first column in the Board view), the tasks will be assigned to the next status (the next column on the right in the Board view).
		  -  The last status cannot be deleted.
