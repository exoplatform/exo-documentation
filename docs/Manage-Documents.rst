The content management is one of key strategies in the organizational
process of each enterprise. A good content management allows you to:

-  Store, share and work on the same content efficiently.

-  Trace changes of content intuitively and instantly.

-  Simplify the way to manage your content.

The Enterprise Content Management system delivered by eXo Platform not only
satisfies basic demands (for example, uploading, previewing and
sharing/editing), but also makes useful capabilities available
(versioning, metadata, advanced searches, and more). These new
management solutions featured in the **Documents** application are built
on existing content management capabilities in a flexible and practical
way.


.. note::    -  The "document" denotes a file, script, image or piece of information.

			 -  The "folder" denotes a directory which contains a set of documents and even sub-folders.

			 -  The "content" is used for denoting both document and folder.


.. _DocumentsInterface:

===================
Documents Interface
===================

After logging into the :ref:`Social Intranet homepage <PLFHomepage>`
successfully, you simply click **Documents** on the left panel to be
redirected to the **Documents** interface. As a normal user, you can
switch between **Icons** and **List** views by clicking |image0| or
|image1| respectively.

|image2|

If you are an administrator, you can see **Documents** in the **Admin**
view.

|image3|

.. note::Refer to :ref:`Views <WorkingWithExplorer.Views>` to learn about differences between views.

The way to do actions on content is different between **Icons** and
**List** views as follows:

-  In the **Icons** view, you can do actions via the Right-click action
   or directly on the **Action** bar.

-  In the **List** view, the Right-click action is disabled.

Depending on your various purposes, you are free to switch between the
**Icons** and **List** views just in one click. That is, if you want to
see your content as images, it is recommended you use the **Icons**
view.

|image4|

But in case you want to see more details directly in the view, the
**List** view is an optimal choice.

|image5|

Here's what you can do in the **List** view:

-  Seeing important details of your content, including name,
   created/updated dates, creator, file size, directly in the view.
   Other information (such as extension, version number) is also present
   here, if any.

-  Showing/Hiding children of content without going inside it. Thus, you
   can have multiple folders opened in the view.

-  Changing the current context for a specific content simply clicking
   its name.

-  Doing basic actions on your content.


.. _NavigatingThroughDocuments:

============================
Navigating through Documents
============================

In the **Documents** application, you can store your content in both
drives and folders. However, to make ease for browsing your content, you
are advised to keep them in relevant folders. You can browse your
content in various ways, for example:

-  In the **Icons** view, double-click the content to open it.

-  In the **List** view, click |image6| to expand a specific folder that
   allows you to see its children without going into the folder. To hide
   its children, simple click |image7| to collapse this view.

-  Enter the path of the relevant content directly into the address bar.

   |image8|

   You can come back to the previous content by clicking |image9|.

-  Browse your content from the left sidebar in the **Icons** view. In
   the **List** and **Admin** views, the sidebar is disabled by default.
   To browse in this way, refer to :ref:`Hide explorer panel in sidebar <HidingExplorerPanelInSidebar>`.

-  Switch to another drive by clicking |image10| on the Action bar. A
   list of drives which are accessible to you will be shown.

.. note:: Depending on your role and permission, you will see various drives. See
			:ref:`Drives <Drives>` for more details.


.. _DocumentViewer:

===============
Document Viewer
===============

.. _Viewable-types:

The viewable document types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Documents application allows users to build custom content types and
provides some built-in content types. It also provides a viewer for
common file types so users can read Office documents, view images or
play videos directly from the activity stream.

When a document has a preview, a part of it is displayed, if not a
thumbnail icon is displayed:

|image11|

When clicking to preview, here is what we got in the two cases:

|image12|

The following types are viewable i.e has a preview:

-  Printable files: *pdf*, *doc* (and other Office files) or any other
   type of files :ref:`JODConverter <#PLFAdminGuide.Configuration.JODConverter>`
   supports. See the full list of types at :ref:`JODConverter, Administrator
   Guide <#PLFAdminGuide.Configuration.JODConverter>`.

-  Images: *png, jpg, jpeg, gif*.

-  Audios/Videos: *mp3, mp4*.

-  ECMS content, either custom or built-in templates, such as a *web
   content* template.

For these viewable types, when you click a document preview thumbnail in
the Activity Stream or select the *View Document* menu from Documents in
the left navigation pane, the **Document Viewer** opens. The viewer
provides a large viewing area and some functions, such as Search,
Download and Print.

.. tip:: To exit the Viewer, hit *Esc* key or click **X** icon at the top right corner.


.. note::The Comment pane, where you can comment on or like a post, is only available when you view a document in the Activity Stream.
		 If the document is an unknown type, you must download it to your local machine and open it with another application.

.. _Office-PDF-files:

Office documents and pdf files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can always view pdf files, whereas Office documents require
:ref:`JODConverter <#PLFAdminGuide.Configuration.JODConverter>` to be
installed on the server. If you cannot view an MS Word file, for
example, contact your administrators.

For these file types, the Document Viewer provides maximized reading
estate and all the functions listed.

|image13|

-  **Page Navigator**

Although you can simply scroll to go to another page, the Page Navigator
provides many page selectors (e.g. previous, next, first and last page
links, page number selector). You can also show/hide the Page Thumbnail
pane by clicking the leftmost icon in the toolbar. Click it again to
close it.

|image14|

-  **Search**: Click the Search icon |image15| to open the Search bar and
   click it again to exit.

|image16|

-  **Download**: Click the Donwload icon |image17| to download the file.

-  **Full screen mode**: Click the *Switch to Presentation Mode* icon
   |image18| to read in full screen. Hit *Esc* key to exit this mode.

-  **Print**: Click the *Tools* icon |image19| then select *Print*.

-  **Comment**: You will see the Comment area on the right side when you
   open the viewer. If it is hidden, you can bring it back by clicking
   the rightmost arrow icon.

|image20|

-  **Like**: In the Comment area, click the *Like* icon |image21| to
   like the post. Click it again to unlike.

.. _Images-audio-videos:

Images, Audios and Videos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For viewable media types, the available functions are Download, Comment
and Like.

|image22|


.. note::Audio/Video playback may require appropriate browser plugins. A
			message like "*Video format or MIME type is not supported*\ "
			indicates that you may need to install or enable some plugins for that media type.

.. _ECMS-content:

ECMS Content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the document is ECMS Content, it is viewable. The following
screenshot shows *illustrated web content*, which is one of the built-in
templates.

|image23|

.. _OpenInOffice:

==============
Open in Office
==============

With the Open in Office feature, you are able to easily edit documents,
spreadsheets and presentations in the native applications installed on
your client, without keeping a local copy.

In fact, this feature already existed before, but since PRODUCT 4.2,
more operating systems and browsers will be supported. You will be able
to open not only Office formats, but also virtually any file format as
long as an application is associated with it in your client.

Depending on the file type, a new contextual action appears as below:

-  **Open in Word** for file types: ``.docx``, ``.doc``, ``.docm``,
   ``.dot``, ``.dotm``, ``.dotx``.

   |image24|

-  **Open in Excel** for file types: ``.xltx``, ``.xltm``, ``.xlt``,
   ``.xlsx``, ``.xlsm``, ``.xlsb``, ``.xls``, ``.xll``, ``.xlam``,
   ``.xla``.

   |image25|

-  **Open in Powerpoint** for file types: ``.pptx``, ``.pptm``,
   ``.ppt``, ``.ppsx``, ``.ppsm``, ``.pps``, ``.ppam``, ``.ppa``,
   ``.potx``, ``.potm``, ``.pot``.

   |image26|

-  **Open on Desktop** for Non-MS Office files that are different from
   Word, Excel or Powerpoint files.

   |image27|


.. note:: The labels used for these buttons can be set by an administrator.
		  See :ref:`how-to <#PLFAdminGuide.Configuration.OpenInOfficeConfiguration>` in Administrator Guide.

This feature can be used not only in the Activity Stream (like above),
but also in many places:

-  Admin and List views (directly on the Action bar):

   |image28|

-  Categories, Icons and Web views (on the right-click menu)

   |image29|

-  File Preview

   By default, in some views (including Admin, Icons and List view),
   these buttons will be displayed as an action on the Actions bar.
   These buttons can be configured in any views (Categories, Web) like
   any other actions by your administrator 
   (Administration --> Content -->Content Administration --> Explorer --> View--> |image30| --> Action tab --> |image31| --> Remote Edit checkbox).


.. note:: These buttons will not be displayed in case multiple files are selected.

**How to use?**

By clicking either of these buttons, you can open and edit that document
in one native application that is registered on your client. A new
version of the document will be automatically created when it is saved
within the Office application.

-  When one document is currently opened by one user, the Lock icon will
   appear next to that file: |image32|. If you still want to open this
   file, one message saying that you can open it in the Read-only format will appear.

   |image33|

-  In case there is no application registered for one file type, one
   message appears, saying that you have no application registered to
   open that file.


.. note:: To make this feature work well, you need to learn about :ref:`Compatibility <Compatibility>`
			as well as :ref:`Client requirements <ClientRequirements>`.

.. _Compatibility:

Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _Basic-compatibility:

Basic compatibility
---------------------

eXo Platform core has a basic compatibility for Microsoft environments. So,
if you are using Windows (7, 8 or 10) with Microsoft Office 2016
installed, you can work with Word, Excel and Powerpoint files in many
browsers: Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari and Edge.

.. note::To make Open in Office work well on IE11, you need to enable ActiveX
			by selecting Internet OptionsSecurity tabCustom levelInitialize and
			script ActiveX controls not marked as safe for scripting, and
			ticking the **Enable (not secure)** checkbox.

.. _Enhanced-compatibility:

Enhanced compatibility
-----------------------

For editing more file types and in various platforms, it is required
your administrator install the Remote Edit add-on on eXo Platform server
(by the command: ``addon install exo-remote-edit``). With this
installation, you can start using Open in Office in more various
environments. Here are the client environments that are currently
supported in eXo Platform:

+--------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| OS                 | Browsers                   | Office suites              |
+====================+============================+============================+
| Windows 7,         | Firefox, Chrome, Edge      | Microsoft Office 2016      |
| Windows 10         |                            |                            |
+--------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| MAC OS 10.12+      | Firefox, Safari, Chrome    | Microsoft Office for Mac   |
|                    |                            | 2016                       |
+--------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| Ubuntu 18.04       | Firefox, Chrome            | LibreOffice 6.0            |
+--------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+


.. note::	-  It is recommended to use the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome.

			-  For Chrome in Windows and MAC OS, you need to enable NPAPI, as said `here <https://java.com/en/download/faq/chrome.xml#npapichrome>`__.

.. _ClientRequirements:

Client requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In client side, you need to pay attention to the following environment
requirements before using this feature.


.. _Windows:

Windows
---------

**Note 1. Allowing to open and edit MS Office file types.**

.. _ConfiguringWebDAVRedirector:

1. Configure WebDAV Redirector on the client.

-  On Windows 7, click **Start**, type *regedit* in the Start Search
   box, and then press Enter. If you are in Windows 8, hold the Windows
   key (WINKEY) + F, highlight **Apps** in the Menu bar, type *regedit*
   in the Search box, and press Enter.

-  Locate to the following:
   ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Parameters``.

-  On the Edit menu, point to **New**, and then click **DWORD Value**.

-  Type *BasicAuthLevel*, and then press Enter.

-  Right-click *BasicAuthLevel*, and then click **Modify**.

-  In the Value data box, type *2*, and click OK.

2. Update the Registry on the client.

-  Locate to the following:
   ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common\Internet``
   (for MS Office 2010) or
   ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\Internet``
   (for MS Office 2013).

-  On the Edit menu, create *BasicAuthLevel* with the same value as in
   :ref:`Configure WebDAV Redirector on the client <ConfiguringWebDAVRedirector>`.

3. Exit **Registry Editor**, and restart your client.

.. tip:: Starting from MS Office 2013 and if you are using the **https** mode either using a 
         :ref:`reverse proxy <PLFAdminGuide.Security.HTTPSConf.Proxy>` or 
         :ref:`running your Platform itself under HTTPS <PLFAdminGuide.Security.HTTPSConf.eXo>`,
         you don't need to proceed by the configurations steps cited above.

**Note 2. On Chrome browser**

If you install both Microsoft Office and OpenOffice, you need to choose
Microsoft Office as default application for office files.

**Note 3. For Non-MS Office files**

When you open/edit a Non-MS Office file, one NPE exception is thrown on
eXo Platform server and even when the file is opened successfully, the
client gets very slow. See `here <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27416798/it-hit-webdav-open-non-office-files>`__
for understanding the problem.

.. _Linux:

Linux
-------

On Firefox, to open/edit one file, you need to install **davfs2** that
allows mounting a WebDav server as a disk drive::

   $ sudo apt-get install davfs2

To open a document using untrusted SSL, you should export your server
certification and then register and trust it on davfs2 by following
these steps:

1. To export the server certification, use this command::

   $ openssl s_client -connect ${REMHOST}:${REMPORT} | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > myserver.pem

2. Register the certification on davfs by copiying it to ``davfs2/certs/``::


   $ sudo cp myserver.pem /etc/davfs2/certs/

3. Trust the certication on davfs2 by editing the file ``/etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf`` and adding this content::


   $ trust_server_cert /etc/davfs2/certs/myserver.pem
     
     
.. note:: For Linux Operating systems, to work with Open in Office functionnality,
          it is recommended to run the platform server on :ref:`SSL mode <Security.HTTPSConf>` with a **trusted certificate**.
          If it is not the case, you can workarround by adding the certificate under **/etc/davfs2/certs**. More details
          in this `link <http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/cosmic/man8/mount.davfs.8.html>`__ .
             

.. _MAC:

MAC
----

-  Enable **BasicAuth None SSL** with the command::

   $ defaults -currentHost write com.microsoft.registrationDB hkey_current_user\\hkey_local_machine\\software\\microsoft\\office\\14.0\\common\\internet\\basicauthlevel -int 2

-  In case you cannot open Microsoft Office files, you should close or
   force closing Microsoft Office Application, then re-open it.

-  In MAC OS 10.12, to edit a text file, it is recommended you use
   TextWrangler (not default TextEditor) to edit it.

.. _WorkingWithBasicActions:

==========================
Working with basic actions
==========================

eXo Platform features some ways for you to do actions on your content
flexibly, regardless of in which view you are using.

Before doing any actions on your content, it is recommended that you
clarify the following points:

-  In the **Icons** view, you can right-click the content that shows a
   drop-down menu.

   |image34|

-  In the **List** view, you cannot right-click the content. Instead,
   click anywhere under a specific area of the content (marked with the
   ticked checkbox). You will see a list of actions on the Action bar
   that are similar to those from the Right-click menu.

   |image35|


.. note:: Depending on the display width of your device, some actions (for
			example, Download And Allow Edition and Copy URL To Clipboard)
			may be grouped in the More drop-down menu.

-  The available actions shown in the Action bar when you double-click
   the content in the **Icons** view are quite similar to those when you
   click directly the content title in the **List** view. The difference
   is that the Overload Thumbnail function is only featured in the
   **Icons** view.

-  See the comparison table as below to have an overview of actions:

-  The saved state of a document is called "version".

-  Versions created for a document behave as parts of the versions
   history.

-  The version on which you are currently working is called the "base"
   version.

Versioning is an optional feature, so you need to activate this for
either an independent file or a whole folder.

.. note::This feature only applies to documents, not to web contents.
			Besides, if you wish to enable versioning for a drive so that its
			new documents will be automatically versioned, you need to contact
			the administrator. See :ref:`Document versioning
			configuration <#PLFAdminGuide.Configuration.DocumentVersioning>` for more details.

The following message will appear.

|image76|

3. Click Activate to enable versioning for the document.

**Enabling versioning for a folder**

You can enable versioning for an entire folder instead of doing it on
every child document of the folder.

For example, here are steps to enable versioning of the folder
``collaboration:/sites/test``.

1. In Sites Explorer, open the drive *Collaboration*, then select the folder.

2. Switch to *Admin* view, and click Actions on the Action bar.

3. Select the Add Action tab. On the dialog that appears, input:

-  Create Action of Type: *exo:autoVersioning*.

.. _Add-version-to-doc:

Adding a version to document
----------------------------

Versioning files is done automatically whenever a user overwrites a
file. There are many ways in which eXo Platform will help you to create a new document version.

.. _Via-doc-app:

Via Documents application
``````````````````````````

In the **Documents** application, there are two ways to create a version
for a document. You can go to the folder that you want to create a new
document version and try one of the following ways.

.. _first-way:

**The first way**

Upload a file (or multiple files) to this folder by using the **Upload**
button on the Action bar or dragging/dropping this file directly from
your computer.

-  If this is a totally new document and the versioning is enabled for
   the folder or the drive that contains this folder, the first version
   will be created as below:

   |image78|

   If the versioning is not enabled, no version is created.

-  If there is an existing versioned document with the same name as the
   uploaded file, a popup with the following suggestions is shown:

   |image79|

   In which:

   -  **Keep both**: no version of the existing document is created, but
      a new document is created with the same name (as a sibling
      document).

   -  **Upload new version**: a new version of the file is created with
      other information, such as title or description of the old
      document kept on the new version.

   -  **Cancel**: the upload is cancelled.

**The second way**

Copy and paste a document (or multiple documents) to a folder which
contains a document with the same name.

-  If the document is versioned, there will be a confirmation popup like
   this:

   |image80|

   In which, the options **Keep Both, Save as new version** and
   **Cancel** are exactly the same as the **Keep Both, Upload a new
   version** and **Cancel** options respectively in :ref:`the first way <first-way>`.
   Besides, if you upload multiple files, ticking the checkbox
   "*Remember my choice for all others versioned documents*" will
   apply the selected option for the remaining versioned files.

-  If the document is not versioned, the options will be the same as :ref:`those <first-way>` in the first way:

   |image81|

   Ticking the checkbox "*Remember my choice for all other versioned
   documents*\ " will apply the selected option for the remaining not
   versioned files.

.. _via-upload:

Via File Upload
````````````````

There is also an another case in which you probably need to create a
document version.

1. Click |image82| in CKEditor of web content or illustrated web content file template.

2. Upload a file to a folder that contains a document with the same name:

-  If the document is versioned, there will be an alert like this:

   |image83|

   In which, the options **Keep Both, Create a new version** and
   **Cancel** are exactly the same as the **Keep Both, Upload new
   version** and **Cancel** options respectively in :ref:`this case <first-way>`.

-  If the document is not versioned, the options will be the same.

.. note::If none of these actions is chosen, the new version of the document is not used and the upload is cancelled.

.. _Via-action-bar:

Via the Action bar
````````````````````

**The first way**

1. Open a versioned document that you want to create a new version in the Preview Mode.

2. Click the **Upload a new version** button on the Action bar.

3. Select a file to upload. Notice that the uploaded file does not need to
have the same name as the versioned document, but it should be the same
file type.

Once the file is selected, a new version with the same name as the
current document is automatically created. One success message will be
displayed.

**The second way**

1. Right-click the versioned document that you want to create a new
version.

2. Select the **Create a new version** button from the popup menu.

This will automatically create a new version of the document based on
the current version so that you can change the document properties on
this version while its content is still kept.

.. _via-webdav:

Via WebDAV
```````````

It is pretty simple to create a version for a document via WebDAV. You
just need to access WebDAV and upload a file to a folder. Several cases
will happen as below:

-  If this is a totally new document and versioning is enabled for the
   folder or the drive that contains the folder, its first version is
   created.

-  If there is an existing not versioned document with the same name,
   the new document will replace the existing one.

-  If there is an existing versioned document with the same name, a new
   version will be created.

.. _Manage-versions:

Managing versions
-----------------

You can manage your versions by comparing with the current version,
adding/removing labels, viewing/deleting versions or restoring to a
specific version. All such management actions will be done in the

======================
Sharing your documents
======================

The section provides you with the information related to sharing your
documents via the following topics:

- :ref:`Sharing directly in the Documents application <SharingDirectly>`

   Instructions on how to share your documents in your spaces using the
   **Share** feature of the **Documents** application.

- :ref:`Sharing via Activity Composer <SharingViaActivity>`

   Explanations on the automatic creation of a new activity on the
   Activity Stream when you finish uploading or sharing a file and
   information related to the update of the activity when you do some
   changes on the document.

.. _SharingDirectly:

Sharing directly in the Documents application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To share a document in the **Documents** application, do as follows:

1. Click **Documents** on the left panel, you will be redirected to the
   **Documents** interface.

2. Select any document that you would like to share. If you are in the
   **List** view, a Share button will appear in the Actions bar:

|image129|

In case you are in the **Icons** view, right-click on the document to
see the Share button in the drop-down menu:

|image130|

.. note:: Only one file can be shared at a time, so you will not see the Share button if you choose more than one file simultaneously.

3. Click on the Share button, you will see a sharing dialog.

|image131|

4. Type the first letter from the username/space to which you wish to 
share the document. A drop-down list with the names of users and spaces 
having that letter appears.

|image132|

5. Select the users/spaces to which you want to share the document.

.. tip:: After selecting at least one user, the share button becomes enabled even without precising a permission.

6. Select the permission: you can choose either can view |view| or can 
   edit |edit|:

-  *Can View* |view1|: space members can only read the file.

-  *Can Edit* |edit1|: space members can read and modify the file.

By default, the *Can View* permission is applied.


.. note:: If you do not have the *Can Edit* permission on this document, only the *Can View* right is available for setting permissions.


.. _Who-has-access:

Who has access section
-----------------------

.. note:: The **who has access** section of the sharing dialog is alimented after the share action i.e. after clicking on Share button.

The *Who has access* section contains the list of spaces/users with whom
the document is shared and the persmission they have on it.

This list is sorted as follows:

|image134|

-  The first entry of the list is the owner of the document, it cannot
   be removed.

-  After the document's owner clicks on Share button, new entries 
   (users/spaces with the corresponding permission) will be added in the 
   bottom of the *Who has access* list.
   
-  Other entries are displayed in a scrollable area. Each entry contains
   : share target (user or space), permission (can edit or can view) and
   a delete icon.


.. note:: If the user enters a username that is not valid, the share button becomes enabled but when clicking on it a warning appears indicating that the username is not valid.
			
			|warning|


8. Add some comments or descriptions about the shared document into the
   succeeding text box. This step is not mandatory.

9. Click Share to finish sharing this document with the selected users/
   spaces or Cancel to skip sharing.

.. note:: - After a document is shared successfully, a :ref:`symlink <CreatingSymlink>` will be created in the destination spaces and put into a folder named **Shared** in the **Documents** folder (if the folder does not exist in these spaces, it will be automatically generated while sharing a file). Therefore, the document could be shared again by any member of these spaces.

		  - This sharing activity will be automatically updated on the **Activity Stream**. Refer to :ref:`Sharing via Activity Composer <SharingViaActivity>` for more details.

		  - If the original file is deleted, all its associated symlinks in all spaces will be removed.


.. _SharingViaActivity:

Sharing via Activity Composer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

eXo Platform continuously improves the pleasure and value in engaging with
the users' community by integrating the **Auto-share** feature into the
Documents application. This integration fundamentally complies with
privacy rules; that is what made in folders (except Public) of the
Personal Documents drive will not be shared on Activity Stream.
Therefore, **Auto-share** is only featured in spaces, and you are
required to be owner or member of the space to see activities updated in
the space's Activity Stream. At the same time, these activities are also
updated in the **Social Intranet** homepage.

Assume that you have created a space or are a member of a space named
**PRODUCT TEAM**, then start doing certain actions in the **Documents**
application of this space.

|image136|

Many of the actions (for example, uploading, editing or sharing a
document) will be automatically shared on **Activity Stream** although
you do not take direct actions to share them. As a result, another
members can see what you are doing on your content via **Activity
Stream**.

.. _CreateNewActivity:

Creating a new activity
-----------------------

Once you have finished uploading or sharing a file to the **Documents**
application of the **PRODUCT TEAM** space, one new activity will be
created on **Activity Stream**.

|image137|

Here, you can see the following main information of the uploaded file:

-  The file name |image138| or title |image139|, if any.

-  The file description |image140|, if any.

-  The file version |image141| and size |image142|, if any.

.. note:: - If the uploaded file is an image, the preview image will be displayed on the activity content as a filetype icon.

		  - If the uploaded file is of PDF or Office, the preview image will be its first page.

		  - If the activity is a document sharing action, a label "*shared a document*\ " will be attached to the activity content.

From **Activity Stream**, you can:

-  Click |image143| to view the document in a larger window.

-  Click |image144| to download the document.

-  Click |image145| to go directly into the **Documents** application and
   edit this document.

-  Click |image146| to give your idea.

-  Click |image147| to show your liking to the uploaded document.

.. _MultiUpload:

Share multiple documents in activity stream
-------------------------------------------

With eXo Platform, it is possible to share activities with multiple
documents. In addition, the upload pop up is improved in order to make
easier and ergonomic the upload process.

.. _MultipleFiles:

Share multiple files in the activity stream
````````````````````````````````````````````

To publish an activity with multiple documents, follow these steps:

1. In the microblog, select File tab. The activity composer will suggest
you either to drop files from your computer using the mouse, to upload
manually from desktop or mobile or to select from existing uploads in
eXo Platform.

|image148|

-  Drag and Drop: Allows you to drag and drop files from your hard disc.

   |image149|

   When droping the file, the area dedicated to the files upload is
   greyed.
   Having the file attached, you can click on the |folder| icon
   to choose a destination folder where to store the file. More details in 
   the :ref:`Activity stream file's classification section <_AS_Files_Classification>`.

-  upload manually: Allows you to select documents from your hard disc.

   |image150|

   Cliking on upload manually opens a window showing a drive from your
   hard disk (it opens files drive for mobile devices) and allows you to
   select one or many files.
   You can select a destination folder for each uploaded file by clicking on |folder2| icon:
   
   |destination|
   
   More details in the :ref:`Activity stream file's classification <_AS_Files_Classification>` section.

-  select from existing uploads: Allows you to select documents from
   your eXo Platform drives.

   |image151|

   You can select documents from Personal Documents drive, it is opened
   by default when clicking on select from existing uploads, or you can
   change to any drive you want.

   If the activity is in a space, the select from existing uploads
   action will open by default the space's drive. It is also possible to
   change the drive.

   |image152|


.. note:: - When you choose to upload manually or drag and drop files to the activity composer, these files will be added to the the folder ``/Public/Activity Stream Documents`` under the Personal Documents drive.

		  - If the activity is posted in a space's activity stream, the files will be added to the folder ``/Activity Stream Documents`` under the space's drive.

2. Choose the manner with which you will upload your files then select 
one or more files.

An information box appears under the activity composer, it indicates
information about the file upload progress and displays the file size.

.. note:: By default, it is allowed to attach up to 20 files per activity and each file's size should not exceed 200 MB. These parameters are configurable in :ref:`exo.properties <ConfigurationOverview>` file. More details :ref:`here <CustomizeMultiupload>`.

|image153|

You can cancel the upload of a file by clicking on |image154| or remove 
a fully uploaded file by clicking on |image155|.

3. Click on Post to publish documents in the activity stream.

.. note:: - When a user posts an activity in an another user's profile, this user receives an email notification.

		  - When a user posts an activity in a space, all the space members will receive an email notification.

		 This email notification will contain all the shared files on a list with the file icon type, the file name and the file size. Clicking on a file name in the email notifications opens it in the Documents application.

.. _MultipleFilesPreview:

Multiple files preview in the activity stream
``````````````````````````````````````````````

While published, an activity appears displaying the attached files
ordred by selection order on the files list.

|image156|

Up to three files are previewed in the activity and a link containing
the number of the other files. Clicking on it opens the following file
from the list of uploaded files.

-  When the user uploads only one file, the file’s container will take
   100% of the file activity area.

-  When two files are displyed in the activity, the file’s container
   splitting will be 50% for File1 and 50% for File2.

-  When three files are added in an activity post, the file’s container
   splitting will be 50% for File1, 25% for File2 and 25% for File3.

-  When the user displays more than three files, the file’s container
   splitting will be 50% for File 1, 25% for File2 and 25% to display
   (+X-2 more) link where X is the total number of files added.

.. note:: If the file uploaded has a preview (such as pdf, images, docx...), a part of it is displayed. If the file has not a preview (such as html, zip, war..), a thumbnail of its extension is dispalyed and a breadcrumb containing infomation about it.

			|image157|

When the user hovers over the file's container, information about the
attached file is displayed. We will have:

|image158|

-  The filename.

-  The file's version (if it is different from the initial version).

-  The file location as a breadcrumb (each element is clickable).

-  The last update timestamp (including the creation date).

-  The last user who made the latest update.

-  The file size.

Each segment of the breadcrumb is clickable and clicking on one of them
opens the documents application in the corresponding location:

-  Clicking on the filename of the breadcrumb opens the file in
   Documents application.

-  Clicking on the file's version opens the version history of the file.

-  Clicking on a segment of the file's location opens the corresponding
   drive/folder.

-  Clicking on other details (update timestamp, User or size) opens the
   file's preview in activity stream.

For mobile devices, the breadcrumb also appears for shared files. When
any of the breadcrumb's details exceeds the screen size, it is either
preceeded or followed by an ellipsis.

The breadcrumb behaves same as for web, its segments are clickable and
it redirects to the correcsponding location as described above.

|image159|

.. note:: A Download all button appears under the activity allowing to download all the files of the activity. It will generate a zip file named **Activity\_ID\_Date**.

		  Date can be in Frensh format if the user is using the Frensh language and in English format if the user is using English or any other language except Frensh.

You can navigate through the list of files by clicking on previous
|image160| and next |image161| buttons. For mobile devices, you should
scroll the screen left for next and right for previous. You can also
close the file preview by clicking on close button.

|image162|

Clicking on a file opens it to be previewed similar as :ref:`Document viewer <DocumentViewer>`.

The breadcrumb appears also in the file's preview but only the file's
location is clickable.

.. note:: When an activity contains some files with permissions (i.e a UserA is not allowed to view some or all documents in the activity), this/these file(s) will not be displayed in the activity stream of users who don't have the permission to view.

Deleting all files of an activity leads to the whole activity deletion
and deleting one or more files from the activity eliminates these files
from the display.

.. _MultiUploadConditions:

Multiple file sharing conditions
`````````````````````````````````

-  If you attach more than the allowed number of files, a warning
   appears indicating that you can attach only 20 files.

   |image163|

-  When selecting more than 20 files form existing uploads, a warning
   appears in the drive indicating that only 20 files are allowed to be
   attached.

   |image164|

-  If you attach a file or many files exceeding 200MB, a warning appears
   to remember you the maximum size allowed.

   |image165|

-  When trying to attach the same file twice, a warning appears to
   indicate you that the file is already attached.

   |image166|

-  If you have, in the same drive, two files having the same name and
   you try to attach both of them, a warning appears indicating that the
   file is already attached.

   |image167|
   
.. _AS_Files_Classification:   

Activity stream file's classification
````````````````````````````````````````

When sharing multiple files in the activity stream by uploading them from your hard disk
either by dragging and dropping or uploading them manually, you can classify them and choose
a destination folder in eXo Documents to store them.

For that purpose, you just need to click on ``Select destination folder`` link.

|dest_folder|

A popup of the documents drives appears allowing you to select a destination folder.

.. note:: When uploading files from a space, the popup list folders of the space's drive, otherwise, it's your **Personal Documents**.

                    
After selecting the files to upload from your hard disk, you can define a destination folder for each of them
by clicking on |folder_icon| at the end of the file's row.

 
|destination_file|

After choosing a destination folder, the Select Folder button switches to display the destination folder with a cancel icon
allowing to restore the default destination.

|destination_selected|

-  If the user deletes the selected destination folder for a file (using cross button), the default one will be used
-  If the user deletes the selected default destination folder for all files, the folder ``Activity Stream Documents`` will be used. 

.. note:: If you don't select a destination folder for each of the attached files, the destination chosen
          in the first step will be the destination of all files.
          If you also did not select a destination neither for all files neither for each file, attached files
          will be stored in the default destination i.e.:
            
            -  ``Space drive/Activity Stream Documents`` if the post is in a space's activity stream
            -  ``Personal Documents/Public/Activity Stream Documents`` if the post is in your activity stream.
