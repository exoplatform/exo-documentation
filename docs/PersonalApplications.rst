eXo Platform provides you a complete notification function which helps you to
avoid missing anything in your organization. As from eXo Platform 5.1, there
are 3 notification types that you can use.

.. _On-site:

**On-site**

This real-time notification helps you receive new information without a
browser refresh. Whenever there is a new activity happening within your
network, it will be pushed into your notifications menu accompanied by
the number of unread messages as follows:

|image49|

When you click the Notification icon, all notifications will be listed
starting from the most recent one:

corresponding activity stream or you can select **View All** to see all
notifications. Besides, the **Mark all as read** function allows you to
change all messages on this menu into the read status. Finally, to
remove any notification item, simply click the corresponding |image51|.

.. _mobilePushNotifs:

**Mobile push notifications**

A push notification is a real-time notification that pops up on a mobile
device (iOS and Android). It is pushed instantly when the action is 
done.

The push notification displays the same content as the on-site 
notification. It also displays the eXo Mobile application logo, the 
site's name (eXo community for example) and the receipt time. 
Clicking on it opens directly the concerned activity.

|pushNotif1|

.. _Via-emails:

**Via emails**



Besides on-site notifications, you are totally able to keep track of
activities and events via emails. In eXo Platform, it is easy to control your
own email notifications from a single location in the user settings.
When this function is enabled, you will receive emails in 2 ways:

-  A notification email with different content for each event type. For
   example, for the activity embedding a video, the message will be
   represented as a thumbnail image of the embedded media, like below:

   |image52|

   By clicking the **Watch the video** link, you will be redirected to
   the activity stream where you can play the embedded video.

-  A digest email that collects all notifications during a certain
   period and is sent once per day or per week.

   |image53|

    .. note:: To receive notification and digest emails as well as on-site notifications, your administrator must enable notification plugins first. See :ref:`Notification administration <NotificationAdministration>` for details.

This section shows you how to manage your notifications via the
following topics:

* :ref:`Notifications settings <Notification-Settings>`
   How to choose specific settings for email and on-site notification.

* :ref:`Managing notification streams <Managing-Intranet-Email-Notification>`
