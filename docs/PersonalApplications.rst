avoid missing anything in your organization. As from eXo Platform 5.1, there
are 3 notification types that you can use.

.. _On-site:

**On-site**

This real-time notification helps you receive new information without a
browser refresh. Whenever there is a new activity happening within your
network, it will be pushed into your notifications menu accompanied by
the number of unread messages as follows:

|image49|

When you click the Notification icon, all notifications will be listed
starting from the most recent one:

|image50|

By clicking each notification item, you will be redirected to the
corresponding activity stream or you can select **View All** to see all
notifications. Besides, the **Mark all as read** function allows you to
change all messages on this menu into the read status. Finally, to
remove any notification item, simply click the corresponding |image51|.

.. note:: You can also view all your notifications in the page ``My Notifications`` accessible by clicking on
          your username then on My Notifications:

            |image90|
            
          It is possible to mark all your unread notifications as read simply by cliking on ``Mark all as read`` on the top of the page:
          
            |image91|
            
.. tip:: When you are not on the platform web page and you receive On-site notifications, 
         to grab your attention, a number appears in the web browser tab indicating the number of unread
         notifications.
         
         If the platform browser tab is pinned, an indication appears near the favicon to attract 
         your attention about unread notifications.
               
                 |image96|
 

.. _mobilePushNotifs:

**Mobile push notifications**

A push notification is a real-time notification that pops up on a mobile
device (iOS and Android). It is pushed instantly when the action is 
done.

The push notification displays the same content as the on-site 
notification. It also displays the eXo Mobile application logo, the 
site's name (eXo community for example) and the receipt time. 
Clicking on it opens directly the concerned activity.

|pushNotif1|

.. _Via-emails:

**Via emails**



Besides on-site notifications, you are totally able to keep track of
activities and events via emails. In eXo Platform, it is easy to control your
own email notifications from a single location in the user settings.
When this function is enabled, you will receive emails in 2 ways:

-  A notification email with different content for each event type. For
   example, for the activity embedding a video, the message will be
   represented as a thumbnail image of the embedded media, like below:

   |image52|

   By clicking the **Watch the video** link, you will be redirected to
   the activity stream where you can play the embedded video.

-  A digest email that collects all notifications during a certain
   period and is sent once per day or per week.

   |image53|

    .. note:: To receive notification and digest emails as well as on-site notifications, your administrator must enable notification plugins first. See :ref:`Notification administration <NotificationAdministration>` for details.

This section shows you how to manage your notifications via the
following topics:

* :ref:`Notifications settings <Notification-Settings>`
   How to choose specific settings for email and on-site notification.
