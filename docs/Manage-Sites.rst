Managing Your Websites
#######################

    Content is a main part of a website that may consist of various
    elements, such as texts, images, sounds, videos, animations, and
    more. In eXo Platform, you can manage both structured and unstructured
    content.

    you need to pay attention to the structure of each content,
    including:

    -  **Main content** contains all key content, such as texts, images,
       links, tables, and more.

    -  **Illustration** is an image which is used to clarify or explain 
       the content. Also, a summary also can be added to this image.

    -  **CSS Data** are used to present the web content, such as layout,
       font, color, and more.

    -  **JS Data** are used to make web content more animating and dynamic.

You need to connect to your WebDAV clients. See
:ref:`WebDAV <WebDAV>` for more details.

It is assumed that you want to access the ACME site using WebDAV, simply
use the URL:
`http://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcr/repository/collaboration/sites/acme <http://mycompany.com:8080/rest/private/jcr/repository/collaboration/sites/acme>`__
into the address bar. After successul login, the ACME site appears as a
folder.

The copied file will be converted to web content that is viewable by

*CSS, documents, js and media.*

After the new content is added, it can be viewed as a folder in WebDAV
or as a page using a web browser.

|                        |    page by clicking the page number or Next in    |
