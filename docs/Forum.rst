Building Your Forum
#####################


    The **Forums** application is designed for the group discussion and
    user-generated content in which participants with common interests
    can exchange their opinions on a subject.

    The chapter provides you a guide to use all **Forums** features or
    to make **Forums** work in your desired manner.

    -  :ref:`Regular user <Regular-users>`

       Detailed instructions on how to do common actions that are for
       regular users, such as creating topics and posts, subscribing,
       using BBCode, or changing user settings.

    -  :ref:`Moderator <Moderator>`

       Introduction to the Moderation tasks that are for moderators, and
       steps to perform them, including: moderating forums/topics/posts,
       viewing all pending moderation tasks, or banning IPs.

    -  :ref:`Administrator <Administrator>`

       Details about advanced tasks that are for administrators only,
       including setting up the Forum portlet, managing
       categories/forums/users and other administrative tasks.

In **Forums**, the role of each user group is clear and very important.
Each role has a set of tasks that they can execute. Administrators and
moderators are responsible for setting up and maintaining **Forums**.
With the highest rights, the administrators are in charge of the entire
management tasks, including form configurations, users management,
permissions, categories, forums, topics and messages. With sub-sets of
administrative permissions, the moderators will manage the respective
sub-sets of the forum.

The user interface will indicate which features are available to you,
based on your role.

-  As a regular user, you will have the User bar and Action bar with the basic actions.

-  As a moderator, you will have the User bar and Action bar with a sub-set of certain capabilities.

-  As an administrator, you will have the Administration bar which is
   basically the User bar with more administrative actions. You also see
   the Action bar with the advanced actions on forums and categories.
   Most of management tasks are shown via these bars.

Using BBCodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BBCodes (Bulletin Board Codes) are special tags in bulletin boards that
help users enrich their posts with formatting and inclusions. They are
useful to provide guarded formatting capabilities to the forum users
without the risk of breaking the HTML markup of the page. BBCode itself
is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces "[" and
"]" rather than "<" and ">" and it offers greater control over what and
how something is displayed.

Depending on the :ref:`BBCode template customized <AdministrativeTasks.CustomizingBBcodes>`
by administrators only, you may find it very easy to add BBCodes to your
posts through a toolbar above the message area on the posting form. You
can either type the BBCode tags manually or use the toolbar in the
posting form. To easily get the BBCode tags without typing them, simply
click the respective icon which is shown on the toolbar above the
message area.

.. _Administrator:

==============
Administrator
==============

With the highest rights, administrators are in charge of the entire
management tasks. In other words, administrators have the global role of
doing significant jobs, including:

- :ref:`Setting up the Forum portlet <Administrator.SettingUpForumPortlet>`

   Steps to configure the Forum portlet, how to specify the category
   scoping, to enable/disable the Forum components and a bookmarkable
   Forum URL.

- :ref:`Managing categories <Administrator.ManagingCategories>`

   Steps to add, edit and delete a category.

- :ref:`Managing forums <Administrator.ManagingForums>`

   Steps to add a new forum, to configure the moderation settings and to
   delete a forum.

- :ref:`Managing users <Manage-users>`

   Steps to promote a user, to modify the forum settings, and to ban

- :ref:`Administrative tasks <Administrator.AdministrativeTasks>`

   Details about how to configure Sort settings, to define censored
   keywords, to customize email notifications/BBCodes, to set up
   auto-pruning, to ban IPs, and to back up a category/forum.

.. _Administrator.SettingUpForumPortlet:

Setting up the Forum portlet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set up the Forum portlet to make it work in your desired way.

1. Open the *Page Editor* page by following one of two ways below:

**The first way**:

-  Click |image129| --> Portal --> Pages.

   |image130|

   The **Page Manager** page will be displayed.

   |image131|

-  Click |image132| that corresponds to the **Forum** page in the pages
   list.

**The second way**:

-  Open the **Forums** application, then click |image133| --> Page --> 
	Edit Layout.

The Page Editor page appears:

|image134|

2. Hover your cursor over the **Forum** portlet, then click |image135| 
in the quick toolbar to open the Edit Mode tab.

|image136|

This form allows you to configure the **Forum** portlet in various
aspects via the following actions:

.. _Category-scoping:

Specifying the category scoping
--------------------------------

In the Scoping tab, you can show/hide categories and forums in the
**Forum** portlet by selecting or deselecting their respective
checkboxes.

.. _Enable-disable-forum-components:

Enabling/Disabling Forums components
-------------------------------------

In the Panels tab, you can enable/disable some components in the Forum
portlet by simply selecting/deselecting checkboxes of the components
respectively.

|image137|

The following components can be enabled/disabled:

-  Show :ref:`Poll <Create-poll>`

-  Show Icons Legend

-  Show Rules

-  Show Statistics

.. _Enable-disable-bookmarkable-forum:

Enabling/Disabling a bookmarkable Forums URL
----------------------------------------------

Before doing this function, you first need to have knowledge of Ajax.
Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is used in the **Forums**
application, aiming at updating a whole webpage or a part of the
webpage.

|image138|

This feature defines how the links are generated in the **Forum**
portlet. You can select to use Ajax or not.

-  By not using Ajax, **Forums** will generate plain URLs in the links.
   The added benefit will be bookmarkability and better SEO as the links
   will be permalinks.

-  Using Ajax, the links will be Javascript based and generate Ajax
   calls. This makes your browsing faster because the whole page is not
   reloaded.

.. _Administrator.ManagingCategories:

Managing categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only administrators can do categories-related management tasks. To
manage forums better, the administrators usually build a good forum
structure using categories. So, a category is a set of forums containing
all discussions about the same subject. See the following diagram to
learn about the typical structure of a forum.

|image139|

.. _Add-category:

Adding a new category
---------------------

Only when you are assigned as an **administrator**, you can do this
function. Normally, one category is created as public and it allows
everyone to access without any restrictions. Meanwhile, one 
:ref:`restricted category <AddingRestrictedCategories>`
only allows specific users/groups/memberships to access. Also, you can
assign moderators to your category and specify a set of permissions for
members in the category.

1. Click |image140| on the Forums Administration bar. 
The Category form will be displayed.

2. Enter the category title into the Title field which is required. Its
length must be between 1 and 100 characters (Special characters and
spaces are accepted).

In the Category tab, optionally you can also:

-  Enter the order of category in the numeric format into the Order
   field.

-  Give a brief description for your category into the Description
   field.
   
.. _AddingRestrictedCategories:

-  Create a category restricted which allows specific users/roles/groups
   only to have access via one of the following ways:

      Enter names of users/groups/memberships into the Restricted
      Audience textbox. The different values are separated by commas.

   -  **The second way**

      Use selectors next to the Restricted Audience textbox.

      **Selecting a specific user**: Click |image141| to open the Select
      User form, then check your desired users and click Add to accept
      your selection.

      **Selecting all users with a specific role in a group**:

      **i.** Click |image142| to open the Select Role form.

      **ii.** Select a group on the left panel and a specific role on
      the right panel.

 ..note:: If you select \* on the right panel, it means that all members of the group are selected.

      **Selecting a group of users**:

      **i.** Click |image143| to open the Select Group form.

      **ii.** Select a group on the left panel and its sub-group on the
      right panel.

      If the group on the left panel does not have any sub-groups and
      you want to select it, click the Select this Group link.

.. note:: The Restricted Audience field is empty, it means any users can access the category.
       
.. _SettingCategoryPermission:       

3. Optionally, set category permissions.

By default, all users have rights to start topics, add and view posts in
forums of a category. However, you can set these permissions and assign
the **moderator** role to specific users/roles/groups.

-  Select the Permissions tab.

   |image144|

-  Do the same as setting the :ref:`Restricted audiences <AddingRestrictedCategories>`
   of a category.

-  Click Add to add selected users/roles/groups to the permissions list.

-  Tick the checkboxes corresponding to the rights you want to grant to
   the users/roles/groups.

To remove permissions of the users/roles/groups from the list, click the
corresponding |image145| icon.

.. note:: - When granting the **moderator** to a specific user/role/group, to allow other users to start topics, add/view posts, you should uncheck these rights of the moderator. The moderator of a category can manage all forums in the category.

          -  When granting any permissions above, if you set the \* membership for the selected group, this permission will be granted to all users of that group, regardless of their membership role.

4. Click Save to finish.
