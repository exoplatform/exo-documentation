Working With Spaces
######################


    The "team work" concept becomes very familiar in business
    environment. By establishing one specific team or group, you and
    your collaborators can work together on important projects. Based on
    the importance of team working, eXo Platform develops the **Spaces**
    application, allowing you to collaborate with specific people. The
    scope of using spaces is so flexible that can be applied for teams,
    themes, communities or any kind of informal groups to your business
    requirements. For example, if you want to work on a team project,
    you can create a space for your team members to make organizations,
    share links and information related to the project.
