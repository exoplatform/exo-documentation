Working With Wikis
####################


    The **Wiki** application provides the content productivity to portal
    users as a tool to forge the unstructured knowledge. With **Wiki**,
    you can create and edit pages by using a simplified rich text editor 
    based on `CKEditor 5 <https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/>__.
    Also, your company can use **Wiki** as an
    internal reference, such as work policy or a public wiki for
    comprehensive product information. **Wiki** along with **Forums**
    will complete the ideal combination that helps users enhance their
    experiences on collaboration activities and build valuable knowledge
    center for clients.
    
.. tip:: When accessing wiki application, a welcome page is displayed 
		 indicating in which wiki you are in.

			-  If you are in a user's wiki application, the welcome page
			   will display the message **Welcome to $FirstName $LastName Wiki**, 
			   where FirstName and LastName are the first and the last name of the user.
			
			   |image95|
			
			-  If you are in a space's wiki application, the welcome 
			   page will display the message **Welcome to Space $SpaceName 
			   Wiki**, where SpaceName is the space name.
			
			   |image96|


.. note:: The message of the welcome page in Wiki application, either 
		  for users profiles or spaces is a static message. 
		  
		  It tooks the first set parameters i.e. the first 
		  **$FirstName** and **$LastName** set by the user and the first
		  **$SpaceName** set by the space's creator.
		 
		  For example, in the case below, the first space name chosen by
		  its creator was "PM Team" then changed to "Product Management 
		  Team" but the wiki welcome page contains always **Welcome to 
		  Space PM Team Wiki**.

This chapter covers the following topics:

:ref:`Managing your content <Managing-Content>`

       Steps to perform common actions on a Wiki page (for example,
       creating, editing, using the editor, managing drafts, adding a
       related page, and attaching files); information about spreading
       your content; how to manage page changes (by comparing between 2
       versions or by watching); and ways to organize your content.

:ref:`Advanced settings <AdvancedSettings>`

       Steps specified for administrators to change space settings,
       manage permissions and author content via WebDAV.

.. _Wiki-layout:

**Wiki layout**


After opening Wiki, you should see the Wiki homepage as below:

|image7|

**In which**:

-  |image0|: The **Breadcrumb** which shows the page hierarchy.

-  |image1|: The Wiki administration area which allows administrators
   only to configure the Wiki settings.

-  |image2|: The **Search** box.

-  |image3|: The pages tree view.

-  |image4|: The **Page Control** area which helps users take actions
   with the current page.

-  |image5|: The page content.

-  |image6|: The page information. Click **number of attachment(s)** to
   open the **Attachments** details panel at the bottom of the page.
   Click **Public** or **Restricted** to update the permissions of the
   page.

.. _Navigate-across-spaces:

**Navigating across spaces**


The breadcrumb in Wiki shows the :ref:`page hierarchy <Page-hierarchy-wiki>` to
help you know where you are staying. Additionally, you can navigate to
another space right in the breadcrumb of the current Wiki navigation. To
quickly switch to another space, simply click the currently browsed
space name:

|image92|

Type your desired space name in the search box to filter the space and
click your space name from the search results. Then you will be
redirected to the Wiki home of the selected space. The "**My Wiki**\ "
and "**Intranet**\ " are displayed by default, which will direct you to
the homepage of your personal Wiki and Intranet Wiki accordingly.

|image93|


.. note::Only spaces where you are their member are displayed in the search result.

.. _Page-hierarchy-wiki:

**Page hierarchy in Wiki**


The **Wiki** content is organized as a page tree in which each page may
contain many sub-pages. The hierarchy is reflected on UI by the
**Breadcrumb** and the page tree in the left pane. When a page is added,
it is always defined as a sub-page to the current one. You can have
wikis for portals, wikis for groups or users.

.. _Wiki-spaces:

**Wiki Spaces**

Space is a set of pages, so the spaces partitioning means that spaces
are independent trees. This separation enables **Wiki** to provide
knowledge spaces for different groups.

There are 3 space types:

-  **Intranet wiki**: The global wiki of the Social Intranet.

An Intranet wiki is published for every user who can access that portal.

-  **Group wiki**: The wiki of a space.

A group wiki can be understood as a space wiki. The wiki application of
a space works as a group wiki for that space. The group wiki can be
accessed by members of that group.

For example:

|image94|

-  **User wiki**: The wiki of an individual user.

Every user has his own Wiki. You can switch to **My Wiki** from the
Select Location drop-down menu or from the drop-down menu of the display
name. See :ref:`Working with your wiki <Working-Wiki>` for more details.

.. note:: In this document, Spaces are referred as wikis, particularly portal
			wikis, group wikis and user wikis.
			Any space which has an implicit root page is named Wiki Home.

+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Admin Wiki           | Specifies who can administrate the Wiki permissions |
|                      | and settings.                                       |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

In the Permission tab, you can:

-  :ref:`Adding Wiki permissions of the users, groups and memberships <AddingWikiPermissions>`.

-  :ref:`Deleting Wiki permissions of the users, groups and memberships <DeletingWikiPermissions>`.

.. _AddingWikiPermissions:

**Adding Wiki permissions**

You can add permissions for individual users, groups of users or
memberships.

1. Click |image89| to assign permissions to a user, a membership or a group
respectively. The form to select the user, the membership and the group appears.

2. Select a user, a membership or a group, then click Add.


.. note:: When ticking any permissions above, if you select a group with the \* membership, this permission will be granted to all users of that
			group, regardless of their membership role.

3. Click Add to add the selectors to the User or Group column in the
Permission form.

4. Tick the checkboxes corresponding to each permission you want to assign
to the selectors.

5. Click Save to commit.


.. note:: View and Edit permissions are applied by default to any Wiki pages unless specific page permissions are set. The super user has all
			permissions implicitly.
    
.. _DeletingWikiPermissions:    

**Deleting Wiki permissions**

To delete the permissions of a user, group or membership, just click
|image30| corresponding to a user or group or membership in the Permissions form.


.. _Using-WebDAV:

WebDAV support in Wiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make easy for Wiki resources management, you can access these
resources using WebDAV. Besides the way stated :ref:`here <WebDAV>`, you can use the following URL format to access the Wiki resources:

-  `http://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcrwiki/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path} <http://mycompany.com:port/rest/jcrwiki/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path}>`__

-  `dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcrwiki/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path} <dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/jcrwiki/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path}>`__

Accordingly, to access the Wiki Home of the "Support Team" space over
Nautilus - the file manager for example, you can use either of the
following URLs:

-  `dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcrwiki/repository/collaboration/Groups/spaces/support\_team/ApplicationData/eXoWiki/WikiHome <dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcrwiki/repository/collaboration/Groups/spaces/support_team/ApplicationData/eXoWiki/WikiHome>`__

-  `dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcr/repository/collaboration/Groups/spaces/support\_team/ApplicationData/eXoWiki/WikiHome <dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcr/repository/collaboration/Groups/spaces/support_team/ApplicationData/eXoWiki/WikiHome>`__

After successful login, you will see the WebDAV drive with all content in that Wiki space.

|image91|

-  Each folder is a wiki page. The folder name is the same as the wiki
   page title.

-  "content" is the file that stores the page content.

Now you can access this drive anytime and manage its folders/files via
WebDAV. See :ref:`Editing a wiki page using WebDAV <Edit-wiki-Webdav>` for more details.

.. _Edit-wiki-Webdav:

Editing a wiki page using WebDAV
---------------------------------

1. Go to the folder that contains the content you want to edit.

2. Use your text editor to edit the "Content" file in this folder. You can
use the wiki syntax to format content as normal.

3. Save the file.


.. note:: -  You can copy/move/delete a page by copying/moving/deleting the corresponding folder.
