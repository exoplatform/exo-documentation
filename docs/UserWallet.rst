General information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cryto-currency
A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets.

A cryptocurrency wallet is a software program that uses digital encryption keys to interact with a blockchain network to enable users to send and receive digital currency and monitor their balance. 
For example, using Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, you need to have a digital wallet.



How to access to your Wallet interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


You can access your personal eXo wallet in one of the two following ways :


1- From your display name in the top navigation bar then "My wallet" from the drop-down menu.

2- From your profile then "My wallet" application.

How to create your wallet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first thing to do is to create your wallet by setting a password. The password must contain at least 8 characters. 

|image3|

Once your password is set, your wallet is created but you will not be allowed to execute transactions (such as purchases in the store or sending tokens from the wallet) until an administrator approves it.  Nevertheless, the wallet interface remains available.

|image1|

The following message is displayed : " Almost done! Your wallet will be ready to use once an administrator approves it.".

A warning message appears behind the label "My wallet" 

|image5|

Once your wallet is approved by an administrator, you’ll receive a notification informing you that your wallet is activated.

All actions become available and you can send and receive funds as well as view transaction history or statistics and reward details.


Wallet security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Backup your wallet
------------------

Each wallet uses a pair of cryptographic keys (strings of characters) : the public key and the private key. The public key represents the address of your wallet on the blockchain network. The private works with the public key to encrypt/decrypt data securely. But it must be secured as it allows to perform any operation with the blockchain account (such as stealing your funds!). Without the private key, access to the funds is impossible. Thus, it's critical to keep your private key in a safe place (such as multiple paper copies if different physical locations) to protect it from loss or theft :

- Click on the security icon to display the security popup

|image6|

- From the security popup, click on "Manage keys". A new tab "Manage keys" is displayed in the popup. Click on "Back up your wallet".

|image7|

- A new popup "Backup wallet" is available with a warning message. type your wallet password in the appropriate field then click on "Display private key"

|image8|

- Your private key is displayed in the same popup. You can save it in a piece of paper or a private and secured folder. Make sure that nobody else can access this information or you will be putting your funds at risk with absolutely no way to recover them.

|image9|

.. Warning:: Remember that losing your private keys means losing all your crypto-money. You must take precautions and be very careful! Even an administrator won't be able to help you if it gets compromised or lost.


Wallet password
----------------

You can change your wallet password by clicking on "Change password" button from security popup. You just need to enter your current password and the new password then confirm.

|image20|

The option "Remember my password on this browser" stores your password in the browser’s local storage to be automatically used for every transaction (including purchases in the Perk Store) without requiring your input each time. 

|image21|

You must enter your current password to activate this option.

|image22|


How to send funds from wallet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To send funds from your wallet, you have to click on "Send" button then, in the "send funds" popup, select a recipient, your wallet password and the amount to send. You can optionally type a label and a message that will be stores in the transaction history.
You also have to choose the type of transaction between three options: "Cheap", "Normal" or "Fast". 
The difference between these transaction modes is the fees and the speed of processing transaction in the blockchain network. There is no guaranteed delay for transaction processing because it depends on how much the blockchain network is busy. But basically, the more you pay, the faster. Below are some indicative delays to expect :
 
- The cheap mode is not expensive but may take up to one day to be executed.
- The recommended mode is slightly more expensive and may take a few hours.
- The fast mode is the most expensive but transactions are usually processed in less than a minute.
