Engaging your collaborators is one of the key challenges for organizations nowadays. 

**eXo Gamification** will help your organization to engage your employees.

**eXo Gamification** is layering game-like features upon the use of applications, such as those used within a digital workplace, in order to boost employee engagement and enhance the use of your digital workplace solution by encouraging collaborators to participate.

When employees are engaged, they participate more on your platform by posting, commenting, sharing documents, rating, downloading and much more.  


**eXo Gamification** is organized into “domains” that include a set of "badges" and actions to earn points.

In this interface, you have two tabs: ``MyPoints`` and ``MyBadges``.

.. _MyPoints:

In this view, you can see these elements:

-  your total points
-  a table listing the events which allowed you to earn points. This table is composed by these fields:

   -  The user involved in the interaction
   -  The event you or another user made and which allowed you to earn points
   -  The date of the event
   -  The amount of points you earned following the previously cited event
   -  The domain of the event

.. _MyBadges: 

In the ``MyBadges`` screen, you can see all the badges available in each domain with statuses:

-  *Acquired*: when the badge is fully colorized it means that you already earned this badge
-  *Disabled status*: when the badge is fully greyed which means that you did not yet earned the badge
-  *Half enabled status*: When the badge is partially colored which means that your earned points in the 
   domain of that badge are between the  minimum and the maximum points of that badge. 
   For example when the score of a badge is comprised between 500 and 1200 and that your score in the domain is 700.
