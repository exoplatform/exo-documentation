The Settings are the same whether you are on iPhone, iPad or on an
Android device. But how to get there is different:

-  iPhone: from any screen, open the side menu and tap Settings.

-  iPad: from any screen, slide panels to reveal the side menu and you
   will see the Settings wheel at the bottom.

-  Android: from the Home screen (with tiles), tap the device's menu
   button and you will see Settings menu.

*Login settings are only available when signed in.*

Options related to your login preferences:

-  **Remember me**: Turn this ON if you want your username and password
   to be remembered. This way, when the app starts and opens the
   Authentication screen, the values are already typed.

-  **Auto login**: Turn this ON if you want to be signed in
   automatically when the app starts.

*Social setting is only available when signed in.*

-  **Remember my filter**: The :ref:`News Feed <Features.News_feed>` allows you to display
   news from 3 streams: Connections, My Spaces and My Activities.
   Turn this option ON if you want the app to re-open the last visited
   stream when you open the news.

Choose one of the available languages from this setting.

If you do not see your language, it is only a matter of seconds to get
you started on our `translation website <http://translate.exoplatform.org/>`__.

This setting displays the accounts configured on the app. Tap one to
open the edit screen. Tap *New Account* to configure a new account,
using the configuration assistant described in 
:ref:`Configuring your account <eXoMobileGuide.Getting_started.Configure_account>`.

.. note:: While signed in, you can edit only the name of the current server,
          but not its URL or credentials.

Few information about the app and the server.
