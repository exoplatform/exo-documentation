.. note:: eXo partnered with OnlyOffice to offer the enterprise-ready version of OnlyOffice editors to its customers along 
          with the **commercial editions of eXo Platform**. Thus, eXo customers are required to purchase a dedicated 
          subscription from eXo to run the OnlyOffice connector add-on on their eXo Platform instance. 
          However, a 30-day trial is prepackaged with the connector in order to test-drive the integration before purchase.

To install the add-on, use the following command:

::

		./addon install exo-onlyoffice

          To create a version of the document in :ref:`Documents application <Manage-Documents>`, you need either to click on 
          ``save`` button of the drawer or close the editor browser tab.

          list in :ref:`Documents application <Manage-Documents>`.

When the summary text is too long, it will be truncated in the corresponding item in the "Version list" and a tooltip with the 
full summary text will appear when hovering over the summary content.
